Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the RWE Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns with the four core components  of 
the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights th e following elements of RWE ’s Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible category , Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP 2018.  
- RWE may use proceeds for the conception, development, construction, installation and 
acquisition of renewable energy production units, specifically solar energy, onshore and offshore 
wind farms.  In regards to solar energy, RWE has indicated to Sustainalytics that  concentrated 
solar power (CSP)/solar thermal facilities are not currently in consideration to be financed, but 
may invest into these CSP/solar thermal facilities in the future. In the event that  financing is 
provided for such facilities, Sustainalytics re commends that the Issuer reports on  the use of 
fossil -fuel backup sources.  Projects will primarily be in Europe a nd North America. Sustainalytics 
positively views investments into the expansion of renewable energy capacity.  
- RWE has set a look -back period o f three years.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- RWE has established a Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”), which is comprised of 
representatives fro m RWE’s Corporate Responsibility, Finance & Credit Risk, Investor Relations 
and Controlling departments . The Committee is responsible for all aspects of project evaluation 
and selection, including reviewing and approving eligible projects for the Eligible Project 
Portfolio, monitoring project eligibility and removing/replacing as needed  
- Based o n this, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- RWE’s Finance & Credit Risk De partment will manage the allocation of proceeds. An amount 
equivalent to the net proceeds raised from the bond(s) will b e allocated to the Eligible Project 
Port folio  based on the recommendation of the Committee . Proceeds will be tracked via RWE’s 
internal tracking and accounting systems. RWE will strive to maintain a level of allocation for the 
Eligible Project Portfolio th at matches or exceeds the balance of  net proceeds from its 
outstanding green bonds. If any, unallocated proceeds will be temporarily held in RWE’s liquidity 
portfolio, invested in cash and/or cash equivalents,  and re-allocated as soon as feasible.  
- Based on  these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Reporting:  
- On an annual basis, RWE is committed to reporting on allocation and, where feasible, impact of 
the portfolio  at least at the Eligible Project cate gory level, starting one after issuance . Material 
developments such as, Framework modifications or allocation portfolio will be reported in a 
timely manner . Allocation reporting will include the total amount of investments and expe nditures 
allocated to the Eligible Project Portfolio , the portion of financing vs refinancing , and, if any, 
unallocated proceeds. In addition, RWE will strive to report  on estimate d positive environmental 
impact from projects using indicators such as annua l energy generation (in kWh) of green funded 
investments ; and estimated annual CO 2 avoided (tCO 2). In addition, RWE may provide 
qualitative descriptions of the outcomes and impacts of selected Eligible Projects.  
- Based o n the above, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8

Conclusion   
Synthesis  Analytics  has developed the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  under which it will issue 
green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance  HPC centres and provide green computing products and 
solutions that improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and capture waste -heat. Sustainalytics considers that 
the projec ts funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact .  
The Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, 
allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the 
use of proce eds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that  the  Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  is 
aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of procee ds categor ies  
will contribute to the advancement of  the  UN Sustai nable Development Goa ls 7 & 11 . Additionally, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Synthesis   has sufficient measures to identify, manage and mitigate 
environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proc eeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  Synthesis Analytics  is well -positioned to issue green 
bonds and that  the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with 
the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.
