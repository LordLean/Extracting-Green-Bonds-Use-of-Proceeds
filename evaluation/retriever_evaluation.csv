Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of BPPEH  
Contribution of framework to The Blackstone Group’s  sustainability performance and  strategy  
BPPEH’s sustainability commitments and activities are considered from the lens of the global parent 
company , The Blackstone Group (“Blackstone” or the “Group”). Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Blackstone  
demonstrates its commitment to sustainability through the integration of ESG considerations  into its  
investment portfolio, risk management  process  and  its own operations .11 The Group specifies its intentions 
to reduce its environmental impact through active management of energy, water consumption and waste.12 
Some highlights of Blackston e’s overall strategy are provided  below:13,14 
• In line with the commitment  to transition ing its investments  to a more renewable energy -based  
portfolio , the Group has invested about  $7 billion in renewable energy since 2011. Furthermore, 
Blackstone  has  reduc ed its holdings of coal , which constitute about  0.1% of Blackstone’s total 
portfolio  and the Group continues to invest in clean energy companies that support the transition to 
a low er carbon economy . Recently, Blackstone also expanded on its sustainability efforts by setting 
a target  of 15% carbon emissions reduction in the first three years following acquisition across all 
new investments where the Group  control s the  energy usage.  Furthermore, t hrough the ","The Company, under the supervision of the Green Finance Committee will be responsible for allocating the

Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 
(GBP)1 and the Green Loan Principles 202 1 (GLP).2 This Framework will be  published in a separate document .3  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party  Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent4 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible  project  categories 
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framew ork’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA, and the 
Green Loan Principles 202 1, as administered by LMA , APLMA and LSTA5; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the is suer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version  1.7.1 , which is 
informed by market practice an d Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of BPPEH ’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. BPPEH  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of BPPEH  to ensure that the 
information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; ( 2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all 
relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  ","7 Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All five use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics has 
focused below on where the impact is specifically relevant in  the  loc al context.  
Imp ort ance of Green Building and Energy Efficiency in Europe  
According t o the  European Parliament, the building  sector is  the  largest consumer of energy in the EU 
representing about  40% overall and contributing  to 36% of greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions .20 In 2018 , GHG 
emissions decreased by 23% compared to a 1990  baseline  level , surpassing the EU’s target of  a 20% reduction 
by 2020.21 Despite  the current trend, additional measures are  required  to meet the EU’s 2030 target of at least 
40% GHG reduction.22 As the direct emission s from the building sector have increased  by 5% f rom 2010 to 
2019 , it is important to recognize th at additional investments in the sector towards green building s and  energy 
efficiency will be required to meet climate targets .23  
To reach the EU’s 2050 target of carbon neutral ity, the  European Commission proposed the  European Green 
Deal to tackle climate change and environmental degradation and highlights the importance of energy 
efficiency in buildings.24 Currently , the renovation rate for energy efficiency projects in  both residential and 
non -residential building  sectors  across the EU countries is close to 1%, indicating current renovation trends 
are  insufficient  in meeting the Paris Agreement targets.25,26  
Based on the above context, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that  financing  projects in g reen buildings and 
energy efficiency is expected to have a positive environmental impact  and contribute to  the EU ’s efforts 
towards  meeting short -term  and long -term  climate targets.  
Imp ort ance of Clean Transportation in Europe  
Transportation is the primary source of air pollution in European cities , and account s for  almost a quarter of 
Europe’s total GHG emission s.27 Road transport,  in particular, represent s about  72% of the total transport -
related  GHG emission s.28 The  European Green Deal outlines an action plan which highlights the importance 
of promoting cleaner forms of private and public transport and the decarbonization of the e nergy sector.29 
With over  60% of the population liv ing  in urban area s, Europe’s  urban mobility activities account for 40% of the 
GHG emission s in road transport.  In response, the European  Commission initiated an Urban Mobility Package 
to advance the development of  supporting infrastructure and increase access to clean transportation 
options .30  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that BPPEH’s clean transportation investments will contribut e towards the 
EU’s target of reducing the transport sector ’s energy consumption and GHG emission s. ","3 This docum ent contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and BPPEH . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Par ty Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed pursuant to the Framework  but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the potential  allocat ion of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as 
being a statement, representation, warrant or ar gument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability 
or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that BPPEH  has made 
available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second -Party Opinion . 
Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Blackstone Property Partners Europe 
Holdings Green Financing Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Blackstone Property Partners Europe Holdings Green Financing 
Framework  is cre dible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components  of the GBP  and GLP . 
Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of the  Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies – Green Buildings , Renewable Energy , Energy Efficiency , Clean 
Transportation , and Tenant Relationships – are  aligned with those recognized by the GBP  and 
GLP . 
- The Framework defines  a three -year look -back period for its refinancing of expenditures; Green 
Buildings may be considered eligible beyond this  time peri od, which Sustainalytics considers to 
be in line with market practice.  
- Within the Green Buildings category, BPPEH contemplates expenditures relate d to building 
acquisition, financing, refinancing and/or refurbishment.  
▪ BPPEH intends to use reputable third -party certification schemes that are robust and 
credible to  determin e green building eligibility  including LEED, BREEAM, HQE  and 
DGNB . Sustainalytics considers the specified certifications to be credible, and their use 
aligned with market practice. See Appendix 1 for further description of the referenced 
building standards.   
▪ While noting that BPPEH has disclosed that the levels cited in the Framework are 
intended to be minimums and that the Company is targeting  higher levels where 
possible ,6 Sustainalyt ics is of the opinion that the certification benchmark levels  
specified by BPPEH  – BREEAM Good, LEED Silver, HQE Good and DGNB Silver  – are 
below market standards . Sustainalytics additionally recognizes that for certain classes 
of developments, such as log istics properties, lower levels of certification may be 
aligned with market expectations , and that approximately 60% of the Company’s 
building portfolio is in  this sector.  Sustainalytics therefore  considers the certification ","[1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10]"

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second -Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second -Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second -Party Opinion. It normally entails an as sessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental  features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification ma y focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestatio n regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can hav e its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredi ted third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified thir d parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2-degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","14 ☐ Linkage to individual bond(s)  ☐ Other (please specify):

BPPEH  has developed the Blackstone Property Partners Europe Holdings Green Financing Framework  under 
which it will issue Green Financing Instruments  to finance  activities across  green building s, renewable energy, 
energy efficiency, clean transportation and tenant relationships.  Sustainalytics considers that the projects  to 
be funded under the Framework  will lead  to positive environmental benefits .  
The  Framework  outlines a process by which proceed s will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and 
commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, 
Sustainalytics believes that  the  Framework  is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the Company 
and that the green use of proceeds categories will contribute to the advancement of  the  UN Sustainable 
Development Goals 7 , 9 and 11.  Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that BPPEH  has adequate  
measures to identify, manage and mitigate e nvironmental and social risks commonly associated with the 
eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  BPPEH  is well -positioned to issue green financing 
instruments  and that  the Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components 
of the Green Bond Principles 2018  and Green Loan Principles 202 1. 
  ","6 implementation of its group -wide  sustainability program, Blackstone has delivered, through its 
portfolio companies , a 15% energy cost savings.  
• Increasing the Company’s portion of certified green buildings  and renewable energy in vestments: 15 
- BPPEH has obtained green certifications for more than 70% of its office portfolio by area  and is 
implementing energy -saving  renovation upgrades to  its Dutch residential portfolio targeted at 
achieving A or B EPC label certificate levels .  
- On-site a ssessments have been conducted across more than 20% of the Company’s logistics 
portfolio, which provide the basis for future portfolio -wide initiatives including solar panels 
where feasible.  
• As a part of its commitment to reduc ing  the environmental i mpact from its own operation s, 
Blackstone’s London office is 100% powered by renewable energy. Furthermore, energy -efficient 
lighting and  low -flow water systems have been  installed in all new  office  buildouts and retrofits.  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Blackstone Property Partners Europe Holdings Green Financing 
Framework  is aligned with the Group’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further BPPEH’s  
action on its key environmental priorities .  
Well -positioned to address  common environmental and social risks associated with  the projects  
While Sustainalytics anticipates  that the net proceeds from Green Financing Instruments  issued under the 
Framework will be directed towards projects that are expected to  have positive environmental impact, 
Sustainalytics recognizes  that such investments  could also lead to negative environmental and social 
outcomes  if not well -implemented . Some key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible 
projects include occupational health and safety, tenant  engagement  as well as  waste  generation  associated 
with installation and upgrade activities . 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that  BPPEH, through the implementation of the policies and strategies  of 
Blackstone , is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation of the following:   
• Blackstone’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which guides its global operations , subsidiaries 
and affiliates  specifies the Group ’s policies as it relates to business ethics, regulatory compliance 
and overall corporate responsibility.16  
• Blackstone’s Rental Housing Approach , in which the Group commits to making a positive impact on 
the communities  where  it invests and deliver high -quality homes  to tenants, treating them fairly, 
consistently and respectfully.17 
• Robust due diligence  undertaken by the Group  prior to the acquisition  of portfolio assets and  
approv al by a dedicated Investment Committee  after  consult ation  with external ESG experts . As part 
of ongoing assessment of its portfolio impact , Blackstone conducts p ost -investment monitoring at 
least annually to ensure  that  overa ll portfolio ESG risk is adequately managed. Some elements of 
this monitoring includes  environmental risk assessment , health and safety law compliance  as well 
as adherence to workplace policies and procedures.18 
• Blackstone has assigned ESG responsibility t o each business unit with oversight by an  ESG Steering 
Committee  that coordinate s the Group’s ESG effort s. In addition, a separate team led by Blackston e’s 
Chief Sustainability Officer has been put in place to promote sustainability initiatives across the 
portfolio companies.19 
Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that BPPEH  has 
implemented adequate  measures and is well -positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social  
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.  ","[4, 8, 9, 10]"

The proceeds of the notes issued by Castellum will be used to finance projects that fall under the 
categories outlined below.  
 ","1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
The Use of Proceeds of this bond are clearly described in the public offering statement. Castellum is 
directing the proceeds to the development and/or acquisition  of new and existing real estate assets that 
are certified against Miljöbyggnad or BREEAM stan dards. These are environmental assessment standards 
that offer clear environmental benefits, such as reduced energy and water use. The properties that are 
certified against these standards are of greater eco -efficiency , with better energy efficiency perfor mance,  
and are a use of proceeds category recognized by the GBP.  ","Reporting  
 Yes  Castellum will publish a yearly report describing the use of funds and 
their adherence to the eligibility criteria on its website. The report will 
contain a list of all eligible projects financed and information regarding 
each project’s adherence to the eligibility criteria will b e provided. For 
financed projects, the report will disclose the aggregate market value 
and the sum of existing external debt for such assets.  It will also 
disclose the sum of unallocated proceeds, including any short -term 
investments. This level of transp arency ensures that investors will be 
made aware if any asset, originally included under the use of proceeds, 
is sold or otherwise impaired over the term of the bond, and the 
proceeds will be reallocated towards new eligible assets. In addition, as 
describ ed under the use of proceeds, the reporting framework ensures 
that if the design stage certification for new assets expires over the 
course of the term of the bond and the asset has not in the meantime 
received operational certification, this will be discl osed to investors and 
the asset will no longer be included under the use of proceeds. 
Sustainalytics finds the reporting to be very investor friendly.  "," 
 5 applicable criteria or to repay a Green Bond. Castellum’s Group Finance Department will use 
intra -group loans, including specifications on the explicit use of proceeds to projects and assets, 
when allocating the net proceeds from the issuance of Green Bonds  to subsidiaries owning the 
eligible projects  and/or assets. In case the account has a positive balance, the unallocated funds 
may be invested in short -term interest bearing securities pending investment in eligible projects 
and assets. Allowed investments are Swedish treasury bills and highly rated short -term bank 
notes (A+ rating from S&P or equivalent rating from Moody’s or Fitch).  ","Although Castellum does not commit to a ratio or target of new vs. 
existing real estate projects selected under the use of proceeds, 
Sustainalytics has reviewed docu mentation of an existing pool of 
eligible assets. Coupled with the company’s public target for 
certification across its entire portfolio, Sustainalytics believes that 
Castellum has sufficient assets and pipeline to allocate the use of 
proceeds. Furthermore , Castellum will report on the respective 
allocation of new vs. existing projects financed, for full transparency to 
investors.  ","2.3.2  Process for Project Evaluation and Selection

 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
Castellum, an industry leader in environmental, social, and governance  (ESG)  management in the 
real estate sector  as per Sustainalytics’ ESG ratings,  has elected to develop a Green Bond 
Framework for the future issuance of interest bearing notes with added environmental criteria. 
The proceeds will be allocated towards the development and acquisition of new and existi ng 
commercial real estate projects with a minimum certification level of BREEAM Excellent (for new 
assets) or BREEAM Very Good  (for existing assets),  or Miljöbyggnad Silver . The use of the BREEAM 
and Miljöbyggnad certification schemes ensures strong sustai nability performance, and 
Castellum has committed to certification levels t hat represent demonstrable improvements from 
the baseline of local regulation. In addition, Castellum commits within the Green Bond 
Framework to high levels of transparency concerni ng the management of proceeds as well as 
annual reporting, including key impact metrics such as energy consumption, water usage and 
water footprint. As a result, investors will easily be able to verify that the proceeds have been 
allocated only towards pro jects that meet the eligibility criteria, and track  the environmental 
impact of the use of proceeds.  Overall, the Framework exceeds the requirements of the Green 
Bond Principles with the management of proceeds and reporting, and  fully  aligns with the 
princ iples with regards to the use of proceeds and project selection.  Furthermore, according to 
Sustainalytics research, Castellum  ranks in the top 2% on sustainability performance among 
peers in the real estate industry  globally  and this  framework  aligns well with overall sustainability 
objectives of the company . Based on the above considerations, Sustainalytics is of the view that 
Castellum’s Green Bond Framework is strong and credible.  ","1. INTRODUCTION  
Castellum intends to issue a series of interes t bearing notes with added environmental criteria  
(hereafter, the Green Bond s) via its domestic medium term note program (MTN). Castellum 
engaged Sustainalytics to provide a second party opinion on  its Green Bond Framework .  
Sustainalytics is the largest i ndependent provider of sustainability research, analysis, and services 
to investors and other financial institutions globally. Sus tainalytics’ opinion intends  to provide an 
assessment of  the framework’s alignment with the  Green Bond Principles1 as well  as assess 
Castellum’s overall sustainability performance and its alignment with the framework.  To come 
to its opinion, Sustainalytics  held conversations with members of Castellum’s Sustainability and 
Finance departments to understand the sustainability impa ct of their business processes , and to 
understand the use and management of proceeds for the company’s  issuance of  Green B ond s. 
Sustainalytics  also reviewed  public and internal documents from Castellum. This document 
contains two sections: Framework Overvi ew – a summary of Castellum’s Green Bond Framework; 
and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion of the framework.  ","2.3.1  Use of Proceeds  
The proceeds of the notes issued by Castellum will be used to finance projects that fall under the 
categories outlined below.  
 ","2.3 Castellum’s Green Bond  
Castellum intends to issue a series of interest bearing notes with added environmental criteria  
(hereafter, the Green Bond s) via its domestic medium term note program (MTN). The net 
proceeds of the issuance of Green Bonds  will be used to finance both the development and/or 
acquisition of new real estate assets and existing real estate assets. All pr ojects financed by Green 
Bonds  proceeds must comply with Castellum’s Process for Project Evaluation and Selection, 
which outlines the eligibility criteria . The following sections summarize Castellum’s Green Bond 
Framework with respect to the use of proceed s, project selection, the management of proceeds, 
and reporting.  "," 
 8 Management 
of Proceeds  
 Yes  The net proceeds of the Green Bond issues will be credited to a 
separate account and Castellum will  keep a record of the purpose of 
the transfers on the account. If the account has a positive balance and 
unallocated funds are  invested in short -term interest bearing 
securities, these will be reported and their intended use will be 
explained. The level of  transparency with regards to the management 
of proceeds is very strong and will allow investors to verify that 
proceeds have only been allocated towards projects that meet the 
eligibility criteria, as well as track temporary investments. Furthermore, 
inte rnal documentation reviewed by Sustainalytics of the tracking 
process makes it clear that the sale of any asset to which proceeds have 
been allocated will immediately result in the balance of unallocated 
funds rising by an equivalent amount as that asset’s  book value. As a 
result, in an event of a sale, proceeds will be recycled and allocated 
towards new eligible assets. This will also be made visible to investors 
through the reporting process, as described below.   "," 
4. REPORTING  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
Castellum will publish a yearly report describing the use of funds and their adherence to the eligibility 
criteria on its website. The report will contain a list of all eligible projects financed and information 
regarding each project’s adherence to the eligibility crite ria will be provided. For financed projects, the 
report will disclose the aggregate market value and the sum of existing external debt for such assets.  It 
will also disclose the sum of unallocated proceeds, including any short -term investments.  
Where Cast ellum is responsible for project operation, the reporting will also contain a disclosure of a 
select set of asset -level indicators and measurements. This includes energy consumption, water 
consumption, GHG emissions, use of renewable energy, as well as the  means of heating and cooling  ","Reporting  
 Yes  Castellum will publish a yearly report describing the use of funds and 
their adherence to the eligibility criteria on its website. The report will 
contain a list of all eligible projects financed and information regarding 
each project’s adherence to the eligibility criteria will b e provided. For 
financed projects, the report will disclose the aggregate market value 
and the sum of existing external debt for such assets.  It will also 
disclose the sum of unallocated proceeds, including any short -term 
investments. This level of transp arency ensures that investors will be 
made aware if any asset, originally included under the use of proceeds, 
is sold or otherwise impaired over the term of the bond, and the 
proceeds will be reallocated towards new eligible assets. In addition, as 
describ ed under the use of proceeds, the reporting framework ensures 
that if the design stage certification for new assets expires over the 
course of the term of the bond and the asset has not in the meantime 
received operational certification, this will be discl osed to investors and 
the asset will no longer be included under the use of proceeds. 
Sustainalytics finds the reporting to be very investor friendly.  ","Where Castellum is responsible for project operation, the reporting will 
also contain a disclosure of a select set of asset -level indicators and 
measurements. This includes energy consumption, water

Cibus  has developed the Cibus Green Bond Framework  under which it will issue green bonds and the use of 
proceeds to finance green and energy efficient buildings.  Sustainalytics considers that the project s funded by 
the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact .  
The Cibus Green Bond Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and 
managed, and commitments have bee n made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of 
proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that  the  green use of proceed s category will contribute to the 
advancement of  the  UN Sustainable Development Goa ls 7 & 11 . Additionally, Sustaina lytics is of the opinion 
that Cibus  has adequate  measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly 
associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  Cib us Nordic Real Estate AB  is well -positioned to issue 
green bonds and that  the Cibus Green Bond Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four 
core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.

Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
The eligible catego ry for the use of proceeds  - Green  and Energy Efficient  Buildings  - is aligned with those 
recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples 2018.  Sustainalytics considers that the eligible category  will lead to 
positive environmental impacts and advance the UN Sustainable Development  Goals , specifically SDG s 7 & 
11. ","3 No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Cibus Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that  the Cibus Green Bond Framework  aligns with the four core components  
of the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Cibus ’ Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible category  – Green and Energy Efficient Buildings  – is aligned with those recognized 
by the GBP. Financed p rojects will aim at improving the energy efficiency of the building  stock 
by constructing, acquiring or renovating  energy efficient buildings. Assets  will be located  in the 
Nordics .5 
- The use of proceeds category may include the financing  or refinancing  of energy efficient 
buildings , including  construction, acquisition and /or  refurbishments. Sustainalytics notes tha t, 
to be considered  eligible, constructed and acquired buildings must meet the following criteria:  
LEED Gold, BREEAM Very Good, BREEAM In -Use Very Good , or an Energy Performance 
Certificate (“EPC”) of class A and B in Finland or of class A, B or C in Sweden. Sustainalytics  
notes that EPC labels A and B in Finland and Sweden constitute the top 15% of building stock, 
but has been unable to confirm EPC label C in Sweden . Sustainalytics encourages the Issuer to 
target the top 15% of b uilding stock . For Sustainalytics’ assessment of the relevant green 
building schemes, please refer to Appendix 1: Green Buildings Certification.  Refurbishments or 
major renovations must result in at least a 30% reduction in energy consumption. Sustainalyt ics 
considers the eligibility criteria to be  credible and expects that the projects will  help to improv e 
the energy performance and efficiency of the assets financed and refinanced.  
- Cibus has established exclusionary criteria which, in  Sustainalytics ’ view, strengthen the 
Framework.6 
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Cibus’ internal process in evaluating and selecting projects is managed by its Green Bond 
Committee (the “Committee”), comp rised of the CEO, CFO and CIO in Finland and CIO in Sweden. 
The Committee  is responsible for selecting assets that are aligned with the eligibility criteria 
outline in the Framework prior to inclusion in the Eligible Assets. The Committee meets 
periodicall y to monitor and review the Eligible Assets portfolio to ensure eligibility. Based  on 
the se elements, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- Cibus ’ management of proceeds is handled by the Finance Department . Green bonds will be 
managed on a portfolio level.  Proceeds will be  tracked on a  spreadsheet , which includes  the 
total amount of allocated proceeds from green bond instruments . Unallocated proce eds will be 
held temporarily in cash.  Cibus intends  to allocate the proceeds within 24 months. Based on 
these elements,  Sustainalytics conside rs this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Reporting:  
- Cibus intends to report on the  allocation of proceeds on its website , on an annual basis , until full 
allocation. Allocation proceeds will include total amount of green bonds issued, share of 
financing vs. refinancing , and the total amount of unallocated proceeds , if any . In addition, Cibus 
is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics , including energy usage in kWh/m2/year, 
estimated annual GHG emissions reduced or avoided (tCO 2e), energy performance certificate 
class (A or B in Finlan d and A,  B or C in Sweden) an d type of certification including level (e.g. 
LEED, BREEAM etc.).  Based on these ele ments,  Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in 
line with market practice.  ","Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:  
☐ Renewable energy  ☒ Energy efficiency  ","2 Introduction  
Cibus Nordic Real Estate AB  (“Cibus ”, or the “Company”)  is a real estate company  focused on acquiring, 
refinancing and developing supermarket and daily -good properties in the Nordic region. The Company had a 
market capit alisation of 745 M EUR , as of May 18, 2020.1 
Cibus  has developed the Cibus  Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to issue 
green bond s and other types of debt instruments and use the proceeds to finance  and  refinance, in whole or 
in part, existing  and  future projects that aim at improving the energy effici ency of the Company’s building 
stock . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in one  area:  
1. Green and Energy Efficient Buildings  
Cibus  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Cibus Green Bond Framework , dated May  2020 , and provide a 
second -party opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the Green Bond 
Principles 201 8 (GBP) .2 This Framework has been published in a separate document .3  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent4 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which th e eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018 ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of  proceeds ; 
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, versio n 1.3.2 , which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Cibus ’s management 
team to understand the sustainability impact of their b usiness processes and planned use of proceeds, as 
well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Cibus  representatives have 
confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Cibus  to ensure that the information provided  is 
complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and 
(3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also 
reviewed relevant public documents  and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
condi tions between Sustainalytics and Cibus . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standard s. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through proj ects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activi ties.  ","Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Cibus Green Bond Framework  aligns with the 
four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based on 
the following:  
  The eligible catego ry for the use of proceeds  – 
Green  and Energy Efficient  Buildings  – is aligned with those 
recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples  2018 . Sustainalytics 
considers that the eligible category  will lead to positive environmental 
impacts and advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals , 
specifically SDG s 7 &  11. 
  Cibus ’ internal process in 
evaluating and selecting projects is managed by the Green Bond 
Committee (the “Committee”), comprised of the CEO, CFO and CIO in 
Finland  and CIO in Sweden.  The Committee is responsible for 
ensuring assets are aligned with the eligibil ity criteria outlined in the 
Framework prior to inclusion in the Eligible Assets. Assets will be 
monitored to ensure alignment.  Sustainalytics considers the project 
selection process in line with market practice . 
  Cibus ’ manag ement of proceeds  is 
handled by the Finance Department . Proceeds will be  tracked on a  
spreadsheet that includes  all issued amount of green bonds . Green 
bonds will be managed on  a portfolio level . Cibus intends  to allocate 
proceeds within 24 months. This is in line with market practice . 
  Cibus intends  to report on the allocation proceeds on its 
website  on an annual basis  until full allocation . Allocation proceeds 
will include total amount of green bonds issued, share of financi ng 
and refinancing  and share of unallocated proceeds . In addition, Cibus 
is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics . Sustainalyics

practice.  ","13 overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluatio n of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental cri teria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certificat ion: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested  by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or asse ssed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or anothe r benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","4. REPORTING

The  use of proceeds categor y is aligned with those recognized  by the GBP , Sustainalytics has focused on how 
the impact is specifically relevant in  the  Nordic  context.  
Improving Buildings Energy Efficiency in the Nordics  
In t he Nordic  countries , the building sector consume s a significant amount of energy for heating , due to the 
cold climate. The  energy use of commercial buildings , such as supermarkets , is primarily driven by lightning 
and HVAC.13 In the following paragraphs, Sustainalytics further describes the Nordic context.  
Office, commercial, public and insutrial buildings account for 36% of total heated building area in Finlan d.14 
Heating is the biggest source of CO 2 emission s in commercial buildings.14 Nevertheless, the consumption of 
energy per unit of heated space has decreased significantly since the introduction of buildings regulations in 
1976.14 Similarly,  building regulations have achieved an em ission reduction of 3.8  Mt of CO 2 in 2020.14  
In Sweden, the energy consumption of space heating per m2 also decreased .15 Between 2000 and 2017, the 
consu mption dropped by 33.46% , from 13.6koe/m2 to 9.0koe/m2 .15 In addition, both the energy and electricity 
consumption per employee decreased in the same period , highlighting the impact of building regulations on 
the energy consumption of new and  renovated commercial buildings.15  
In early acknowledgement of the contribution of buildings’ energy consumption to cl imate change, Norway 
placed the building industry on its environmental agenda in 1998, notably through energy efficiency 
requirements and buildings regulation.16, 17 As such, both the energy and electricity consumption per employee 
decreased  significantly between 2000 and 2017 .18 Projects financed under the Framework could assist 
Norway in reducing commercial buildings energy and electricity consumption.  
In Denmark, energy consumption for heating per m2  has decreased on average by 1.2% per year between 
2000 and 2017.19 Furthermore, both the energy and electricity consumption per em ployee have reduced by 
10.7% and 8.2% respectively.19  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that , while the Nordic countries are  doing well in reducing the energy 
consumption of their building stock, Cibus’  financing green  and energy efficient  commer cial buildings can 
further  contribute to reducing buildings’ energy consumption  and subsequent GHG emissions.  
Alignment with/ contribution  to SDGs  
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving 
sustainab le development by the year 2030. This  green bond advances the following SDG goal  and target:

CTP  has developed the CTP Green Bond Framework  under which it will issue green bonds and the use of 
proceeds to finance r eal estate development and upgrades that may contribute to the improvement of the 
energy performance of the building stock and increase renewable energy capacity in CEE, th us facilitating 
transition to a low‐carbon economy.  Sustainalytics considers that the projects  funded by the green bond 
proceeds will provide positive environmental impact.  
The CTP Green Bond Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked,  allocated, and 
managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of 
proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the CTP Green Bond Framework  is aligned with the overall 
sustainability strategy of the com pany and that the green use of proceeds  categories  will contribute to the 
advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 11. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion 
that CTP  has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environme ntal and social risks commonly 
associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that CTP Group  is well -positioned to issue green bonds and 
that the CTP Green Bond Framework  is robust, tran sparent, and in alignment with the four core components 
of the Green Bond Principles 2018.

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the CTP Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the CTP Green Bond Framework  is credible and impactful and aligns with 
the four core components of the GBP 2018. Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of CTP ’s Green 
Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eli gible categories – Green Buildings and  Renewable Energy – are aligned with those 
recognized by the GBP 2018. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the projects financed and 
refinanced under this Framework will contribute to the improvement of the energy pe rformance 
of CTP’s building stock and increase renewable energy capacity, thus facilitating the transition 
to a low‐carbon economy. Sustainalytics notes that the financed and refinanced projects will be 
located in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).4 
- CTP may finance or refinance the construction, development, or upgrades of new or existing 
industrial5 and/or commercial green buildings in Central and Eastern Europe. The eligibility 
criterion incorporates the following standards: (i) BREEAM Very Good or above, (ii) LEED Gold or 
above, (iii) any other recognized green building standard considered to be eq uivalent. 
Sustainalytics positively notes the establishment of minimum certification levels. For 
Sustainalytics’ assessment of green building certification schemes, please refer to Appendix 1.  
- Within the Renewable Energy  category, the Company may finance o r refinance the acquisition, 
development, construction and/or installation of renewable energy production units, from the 
following sources: solar and wind. Sustainalytics views investments in  these technologies as 
environmentally beneficial.  
• Project Evalu ation and Selection:  
- CTP Group ’s internal process in evaluating and selecting projects is managed by the Green Bond 
Committee (the “Committee”), which is co -chaired by the Group’s CEO and CFO as well as 
representatives from the Funding, Design and Constru ction teams. The Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that eligible projects comply with eligibility criteria in the Framework 
prior to being selected for the Green Asset Pool. The Committee will also monitor the Green 
Asset Pool throughout the lifetime o f the bond to ensure that assets continue to meet eligibility 
criteria. If a project no longer meets eligibility criteria, it will be removed from the Green Asset 
Pool and replaced as soon as practically feasible. B ased on these elements , Sustainalytics 
considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- CTP Group ’s processes for management of proceeds are handled by the Funding team , which  
will track the allocation of proceeds to new or existing projects in line with  its inte rnal systems. 
Unallocated proceeds will be temporarily invested or held in cash  or cash equivalents. The 
Company intends to fully allocate the proceeds within three years of bond issuance. Based on 
these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process to b e in line with market practice.  
• Reporting:  
- CTP Group  intends to report allocation proceeds on its website, on an annual basis, until full 
allocation. The allocation reporting will include the total amount of proceeds allocated, the share  
of new financing and refinancing, the number of projects and level of certification, and the 
balance of unallocated proceeds. In addition, CTP Group  plans  to report on relevant ","Section 3. Detailed review

ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures , such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. It can include an as sessment of the issuer’s overarching 
objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an evaluation of the 
environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds fro m Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a re cognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an establi shed scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which  may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","5 habitats.” Concerning land use the Directive notes that the “EIA shall identify, describe and assess 
land  use related impacts”.7 
• Regarding worker health and safety, the EU Directive on Worker Health and Safety ensures minimum 
safety and health requireme nts throughout Europe. Employers “have a duty to ensure the safety and 
health of workers in every aspect related to the work.” Necessary measures due to be taken by the 
employers include “prevention of occupational risks and provision of information and tr aining, as 
well as provision of the necessary organization and means.”8 
• In accordance with EU regulation on construction and demolition waste (CDW), CTP is required to 
follow the guidelines set out by each of the Member States that the company operates in . These 
regulations are aimed at ensuring waste management is carried out without endangering human 
health or causing harm to the environment.9 
• CTP has appointed a community manager for CTP’s Brno region to act as a Proof of Concept  for the 
Group. The manager actively engages with community members to embed CTP’s activities in the 
community, identify and act to meet community demands as they relat e to the Group's activities.10 
Based on these policies, standards,  and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that CTP  has 
implemented adequate measures and is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social 
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
The two  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics has focused 
on green buildings below where the impact is specifically relevant in the local c ontext.  
Importance of Green Buildings in Central and Easter Europe  
The EU’s real estate sector accounts for 40% of the European block’s total energy consumption and 36% of 
its CO 2 emissions.11 This is particularly relevant in Central and Eastern Europe (CE E), where the real estate 
sector can account for up to 50% of a countries’ total energy consumption, such as in Hungary,12 followed by 
Slovakia 42%, Romania 41%, Czechia  38%,13 and 35% in Serbia.14 Moreover, approximately 35% of the EU’s 
building st ock is over 50 years old, and approximately 75% of EU building stock is considered energy 
inefficient.11 According to the European Commission, the renovation and retrofit of existing buildings has the 
potential to reduce the EU’s total energy consumption by 5 -6% and lowering total CO 2 emissions b y about 
5%.11 To achieve the potential energy savings the EC’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires all 
member states to establish a l ong -term renovation strategy to support the renovation of their national building 
stock into a highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050.15  
Energy efficiency interventions in the building stock and the increased adoption of green buildings’ practices 
in CEE countries could result in proportionally greater benefits than elsewhere in Europe. In this line, CEE 
countries are introducing measures and strategies to achieve potential energy gains. For example , the 
Czechia ’s p rojects that the implementation of the Directive could lead to emissions reduction per unit of floor 
area of a building by 25 to 40% compared to 2010  levels .16 Similarly, Slovakia identifies buildings’ renovation 
as the most important source of possible en ergy savings, between 30% and 60%, by 2030 compared to 2010  
levels .17 Romania aims for a 37.5% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, and  intends  to support energy ","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10]"

CTP Group (“CTP”, or “the Company”) is an industrial and logistics real estate developer, owner, and manager, 
primarily operating in Czechia . CTP has 370 employees, spread around 96 locations in Czechi a, Romania, 
Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, an d Serbia. Founded in 1998, CTP Group is headquartered in Humpolec, Czechia . 
CTP has developed the CTP Green Bond Framework (the “Framework”) under which it intends to issue green 
bonds and use the proceeds to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in  part, existing and/or future projects 
that promote the transition to low ‐carbon and climate resilient growth. The Framework defines eligibility 
criteria in two  areas:  
1. Green Buildings  
2. Renewable Energy  
CTP  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  CTP Green Bond Framework , dated August  2020 , and provide a 
second -party opinion on the Framework’s environmental credentials and its alignment with the Green Bond 
Principles 2018 (GBP).1 This Framework has been published in a separate document.2  
Scope of work and  limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categor ies are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA;  
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds;  
• The alignment of the issuer’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds.  
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.4.1, whi ch is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of CTP ’s management 
team to understand the sustainability impact of their busine ss processes and planned use of proceeds, as 
well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. CTP  representatives have 
confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of CTP  to ensure that the information provided is 
compl ete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant information and 
(3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also 
reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions betwee n Sustainalytics and CTP . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore , Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities.  ","18 Ministry of Energy, “ Integrated National Energy and Climate Change  Plan for 2021 - 2030 ”, at:

Section 2: Sustainability Strategy of CTP  
Contribution of framework to CTP Group ’s sustainability strategy  
CTP’s sustainability strategy is capt ured by its objective to achieve net operational carbon neutrality by 2023.6 
In order to fulfil its goal, the Company has focused on four key environmental pillars: (i) sustainable building 
certification for all its properties, (ii) circularity, (iii) ren ewable energy, and (iv) conservation.6 The Company’s 
commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by the initiatives outlined below:  
• By 2021, CTP plans to certify the entirety of its building’s portfolio as green by the BREEAM 
certification. The Company has informed Sustainalytics that more than 75% of CTP’s portfolio is 
BREEAM certified, as of August 2020. Upon completion of the certification initi ative more than 300 
buildings across six countries will be BREEAM certified, including new development and standing 
portfolio.6 
• CTP has introduced t he concept of “circular parks” to its office portfolio which includes implementing 
additional waste reduction and energy efficiency measures.6  
• Start ing in 2020, CTP is committed to deliver all new buildings with solar panels already installed or 
with the necessary technology to install rooftop solar farms. Currently, around 70% of standing 
portfolio in CZ is suitable for installing rooftop photovoltai cs.6 
• CTP owns and operates  solar farms in Czechia  with an installed capacity of 6  MW and t argets to 
further develop installed electricity capacity in the country.6 
• The Company has committed to investing in the conservation and management of mature natural 
forests, to preser ve biodiversity and protect carbon sinks as part of the carbon neutrality strategy. 
CTP plans to invest in forest conservation on a 1:1 ratio to the Company’s built portfolio.6 Since 2019, 
the Company owns and conserves 100 hectares of a forest preserve in Czechia , bringing the ratio in 
Czechia  to 1 m2 of build portfolio to 0.28 m2 of forest preserve by June 30, 2020.  ","[1, 4, 8, 10]"

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance 
Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance Framework  is credible and impactful, 
and aligns with the  four core components  of the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights the following 
elements of Deutsche Woh nen ’s Green Finance Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies  − Green Buildings , Renewable Energy  and Clean Transportation  − are  
aligned with those recognized by the GBP  and GLP .  
- The Framework  defines a look -back period of 36 months for its capital expenditure for  existing 
assets,  which Sustainalytics considers to be in line with market practice . 
- Under the Green Buildings category, Deutsche Wohnen contemplates expenditures related to  
the  acquisition, new construction , refurbishment and management of commercial and 
residential build ings.  
▪ Deutsche Wohnen intends to use reputable third -party certification schemes and 
standards to determine  green building eligibility.  The Framework specifies minimum 
standards of DGNB Gold , Energy Performance Certificate  (EPC) B ,6 or other equivalent 
certification. Furthermore, the Company may consider buildings that (i) have the 
NaWoh certification label or (ii) are in  compliance with the requirements of the KfW 55 
Standard .  
• Sustainalytics views the selected standards as robust and credible  and the 
specified  certification levels  as aligned with market, and for projects eligible 
based on  the NaWoh label additionally encourages the Company  to fulfill the  
“übererfüllt” criteria .7 See Appendix 1 for assessment of the referenced 
certification sc hemes and standards.   
▪ For refurbished buildings, Deutsche Wohnen intends to invest in the renovation of 
existing buildings that lead to a 30% minimum improvement of primary energy demand 
compared to  a baseline. Sustainalytics views favourably that the Fram ework defines a 
quantitative  minimum threshold  improvement  and considers a 30% improvement to be 
aligned with market practice .  
▪ The Company’s renovation activities  may include the replacement of windows , 
insulation , as well as combined heat and power plant s (CHP) . The Framework specifies  
that fossil -related technologies are excluded from investments related to CHP plan ts. ","2 Introduction

its focus on energy -efficient properties while maintaining cost -effectiveness and  high housing quality.9 The 
Company  has established a strategic su stainability programme that is built on five areas of action : (i) 
responsible corporate management , (ii) responsibility for the environment and climate , (iii) customer 
satisfaction and sustainable construction , (iv) responsibility for employees , and  (v) re sponsibility towards 
society.9 
In order to advance its commitment to sustainable construction, Deutsche Wohnen set strategic targets of 
EUR 300 million annual portfolio investments in building refurbishment  as well as creat ion of new districts 
that achieve recognized certifications such as NaWoh or DGNB for up to 10,000 customers  by 2025 .9 In 2019, 
Deutsche Wohnen compl eted 24 residential units which received DGNB Platinum and 44  residential  units that 
were awarded the NaWoh quality seal.  ","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10]"

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second -Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second -Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second -Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with  the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated  Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised  research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","Deutsche Wohnen  intends to report on the allocation  of proceeds annually on its website until full allocation

in Berlin, Germany.  Deutsche Wohnen’s  property portfolio consists of over 160,000  residential and commercial  
buildings with a total value of approximately EUR 26.2 billion. Deutsche Wohnen’s business focus is residential 
properties in Germany’s metropolitan areas with 74% of its portfolio loc ated in Berlin.  
Deutsche Wohnen  has developed the Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under 
which it intends to issue green bonds , loans , and other debt -like instruments  and use the proceeds to finance  
and/ or refinance, in whole or i n part, existing  and/ or future projects that  are expected to reduce the carbon 
footprint of Deutsche Wohnen’s building stock.  The Framework defines eligibility criteria in three  green  areas:  
1. Green Buildings  
2. Renewable Energy  
3. Clean Transportation  
Deutsche Wohnen  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance Framework , dated 
March  2021 , and provide a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its 
alignment  with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP)1 and the Green Loan Principles 2020 (GLP).2 This 
Framework has been published in a separate document .3  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion  reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent4 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible  project  categories 
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framew ork’s alignment with the GBP , as administered by ICMA, and the GLP , as administered 
by LMA , APLMA and LSTA5; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance  and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.7 .1, which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research  provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Deutsche Wohnen ’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of pro ceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Deutsche Wohnen  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Deutsche Wohnen  to ensure 
that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics 
with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics  also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted acc ording to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Deutsche Wohnen . ","3 Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment w ith future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond and loan proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measu rement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the potential  allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of the bond and loan proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as 
being a statement, rep resentation, warrant or argument , either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability 
or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Deutsche Wohnen  
has made available to Sustainalytics for the purpose of this Second -Party Opinion . 
Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance 
Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance Framework  is credible and impactful, 
and aligns with the  four core components  of the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights the following 
elements of Deutsche Woh nen ’s Green Finance Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies  − Green Buildings , Renewable Energy  and Clean Transportation  − are  
aligned with those recognized by the GBP  and GLP .  
- The Framework  defines a look -back period of 36 months for its capital expenditure for  existing 
assets,  which Sustainalytics considers to be in line with market practice . 
- Under the Green Buildings category, Deutsche Wohnen contemplates expenditures related to  
the  acquisition, new construction , refurbishment and management of commercial and 
residential build ings.  
▪ Deutsche Wohnen intends to use reputable third -party certification schemes and 
standards to determine  green building eligibility.  The Framework specifies minimum 
standards of DGNB Gold , Energy Performance Certificate  (EPC) B ,6 or other equivalent 
certification. Furthermore, the Company may consider buildings that (i) have the 
NaWoh certification label or (ii) are in  compliance with the requirements of the KfW 55 
Standard .  
• Sustainalytics views the selected standards as robust and credible  and the 
specified  certification levels  as aligned with market, and for projects eligible 
based on  the NaWoh label additionally encourages the Company  to fulfill the  
“übererfüllt” criteria .7 See Appendix 1 for assessment of the referenced 
certification sc hemes and standards.   
▪ For refurbished buildings, Deutsche Wohnen intends to invest in the renovation of 
existing buildings that lead to a 30% minimum improvement of primary energy demand 
compared to  a baseline. Sustainalytics views favourably that the Fram ework defines a 
quantitative  minimum threshold  improvement  and considers a 30% improvement to be 
aligned with market practice .  
▪ The Company’s renovation activities  may include the replacement of windows , 
insulation , as well as combined heat and power plant s (CHP) . The Framework specifies  
that fossil -related technologies are excluded from investments related to CHP plan ts. ","5 As part of the Company’s  focus on its environmental impact , Deutsche Wohnen  has outline d a goal  to reduce 
CO 2 emissions from  its oper ations  by 20,000 tonnes annually , increase its reliance on renewable energy 
sources  and accelerate energy efficiency through  refurbishment of its  property  holdings.10 In 2019, to achieve  
these targets  and to contribut e to Germany’s overall climate goals , the Company invested over EUR 50 million 
in climate protection focused on its building portfolio.10 This  translated to a reduction of  Deutsche Wohnen ’s 
carbon emissions by over 25,000 tonnes . At the end of 2020, 62%  of the Company’s building  stock perform ed 
above the average energy efficiency of a German residential building.10  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Deutsche Wohnen Green Finance Framework  is aligned with the 
company’s overall sustainability strategy and initiatives and will further the Company’s action on its key 
environmental priorities.  
Well -positioned to address  common environmental and social risks associated with  the projects  
While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bonds and/or loans issued under the 
Framewor k will be directed towards eligible projects that are anticipated to have positive environmental 
impact, as with any physical undertaking such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and 
social outcomes . Some key environmental and socia l risks associated with the eligible projects could include , 
effluents and waste generated in construction , occupational health and safety  and tenant protections . 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Deutsche Wohnen  is able to manage and/or mitigate poten tial risks 
through implementation of the following : 
• During the  building life cycle , the Company adheres to the requirements of recognized sustainability 
certificat ion schemes  such as NaWoh and  DGNB  through the development, planning, and 
construction  stages , and includes relevant sustainability targets in its contracts or project 
agreements with external parties.11 In addition , Deutsche Wohnen  assesses  the materials used by 
its suppliers, ensuring use of non -hazardous  and/or sustainable construction materials. Waste 
disposal  is carried out  in accordance with the Company’s Code of Conduct for Business Partners , 
through which Deutsche Wohnen requires it s contactors  to dispose  of waste generated in 
construction in line with regulations , minimiz ing  risk to people and the environment.11  
• Deutsche Wohnen’s contracts are developed in alignment with Germany’s Regulati ons on Contract 
Awards for Public Works . This includes  requir ements for  contractors to take  responsibility for and 
implement  measures that ensure  worker health and safety at construction sites.11 For large  scale  
construction  projects , Deutsche Wohnen develops a dedicated health and safety plan supervised by  
an appointed health and safety coordinator. In addition to these measures, Deutsche Wohnen’s Code 
of Conduct for suppliers requires compliance  with applicable laws  and avoid all forms of unethical 
or illegal working conditions.11  
• The Company promise to tenants which encapsulate s its commitments to limiting the negative 
social impacts  of the building activities . This includes protecting tenants from losing their 
apartments or experiencing rent increases due to these improvements. In this regard, Deutsche 
Wohnen recorded 343 cases where it partially or fully waived the right to increase rents arising from 
modernization under section 558 of the German Civil Code.12 
Notably,  the projects financed under the Frame work will take place in Germany  which is  recognized as a 
Designated Countr y under the Equator Principles, indicating robust environmental and social governance 
legislation systems and institutional capacity .13  
Based on these policies, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Deutsche Wohnen  
has implemented adequate  measures and is well -positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and 
social  risks commonly associated with the eligible c ategories.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All three  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics 
has focused on  green buildings in Germany where the impact is specifically relevant in  the  local conte xt. ","[8, 9]"

Conclusion   
Globalworth has developed the Globalworth  Green Bond Framework  under which it will issue green bonds and 
use the  proceeds to finance investments in green buildings and building efficiency upgrades in Poland and 
Romania . Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the green bond proceeds will provide a positive 
environmental impact  by improving the energy efficiency of the build ing portfolio owned and operated by GWI .  
The Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and 
commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, 
Sustainalyt ics believes that the Framework  is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company 
and that the green use of proceeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals 7: Affor dable & Clean Energy and 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities . Additionally, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Globalworth  has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate 
environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Globalworth  is well -positioned to issue green bonds and 
that t he Globalworth  Green Bond Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core 
components of the Green Bond Princi ples 2018.  ","

Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on t he Globalworth  Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that th e Globalworth  Green Bond Frame work  aligns with the four core 
components  of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Globalworth’s  Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies , green buildings and energy efficiency, are  aligned with those recognized 
by the GBP.  
- The Framework allows for the financing or refinancing of buildings  compliant with third -party 
certification standards such as LEED (“Gold” or higher) and BREEAM (“Excellent” or higher). 
Sustainalytics considers these certifications to be credible and the levels selected to be 
impactful and aligned with market practice. Please refer to Appendix 1 for Sustainalytics ’ 
assessment of these certification schemes.   
- GWI may also finance the costs of renovating or refurbishing existing buildi ngs, and has defined 
two paths to eligibility for these projects, both of which Sustainalytics views positively:  
▪ Any renovation which achieves a 30% improvement in Primary Energy Demand is 
eligible; this 30% threshold is aligned with market practice and reflected in standards 
such as the EU Taxonomy4 and the Climate Bonds Initiative ;5 
▪ Any major renovation6 which complies with the requirements for cost -optimal 
minimum energy performance, under the applicable implementation of the Energy 
Per formance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) .7 Thi s criteri on is reflected in the EU 
Taxonomy.  
- The Framework define s a list o f specific “individual measures”; the costs of these projects are 
definitionally eligible , without any required demonstration of performance improvement , 
including  actions such as the addition of insulation to existing buildings, HVAC and lighting 
upgrades, electric vehicle charging stations, and on -site renewable energy systems.8 
Sustainalytics considers the se pro ject types to be aligned with green bond market practice, 
noting that some of these investments ma y be directed to equipment powered by fossil fuels .  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Globalworth’s process for project evaluation and selection is carried out by a Gree n Bond 
Committee (“Committee”)  in collaboration with relevant internal teams, including investments, 
projects management  or legal. The Committe e, chaired by GWI’s Deputy Chief Investment 
Officer , is responsible for screening potential projects against the eligibility criteria and  will make  
recommend ations on  eligible projects for inclusion in the Eligible Green Projects Portfolio  to the 
Company’s Board of Directors .  
- The Committee will also monitor projects on at least an annual basis t o ensure projects remain 
eligible. In the event a project is no longer eligible, it will be removed and replaced as soon as 
practically feasible.  
- Based on the establishment of a Committee and sign -off by  the Board , Sustainalytics considers 
this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- GWI will allocate proceeds to the Eligible Green Projects Portfolio (“Portfolio”) and will strive to 
ensure that the value  of the Portfolio matches or exceeds the value of the net proceeds from the 
green bonds  within 24 months of issuance .  
- In the event of any unallocated proceeds, GWI will hold and/or invest, at its own discretion, in its 
treasury portfolio, in cash or other short -term liquid instruments.  ","10

market practice.  ","ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information bar riers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent ve rification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environ mentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, st atement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green s tandard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer  can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating metho dology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as ","Section 2 . Review overview

that t he Globalworth  Green Bond Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core 
components of the Green Bond Princi ples 2018.  ","Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that th e Globalworth  Green Bond Framework  aligns with 
the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based 
on the following:  
  The eligible categor ies  for the use of proceed s, 
Green Build ings and Energy Efficiency , are aligned with those 
recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples  2018 . Sustainalytics 
considers that the eligible categor ies  will lead to positive 
environmental impacts and advance the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals , specifically SDG s 7 & 11.  
  Globalworth’s  internal 
process of evaluating and select ing projects  is carried out by the 
Green Bond Committee . The Committee is responsible for screening 
projects against the eligibility criteria  and  recommend ing  eligible 
projects for i nclusion in the Eligible Green Project Portfolio . The 
Portfolio will be re viewed annually to ensure projects’ eligibility and, 
if no longer eligible, projects will be removed and replaced  as soon 
as practically feasible.   Sustainalytics considers the project selection 
process in line with market practice . 
  Globalworth will strive to ensure that 
the level of allocation  to the Eligible Green Projects Portfolio 
matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds from its 
outstanding green bonds. In case of any unallocated proceeds, 
Globalworth will hold and/or invest , at its own discretion, in its 
liquidity p ortfolio . This is in line with market practice . 
  Globalworth  intend s to report on allocation of proceeds 
on its website , on an annual basis , until full allocation . Globalworth 
will report on the total amount of allocation, the share of financing 
vs. refin ancing  and the details of portfolio. In addition,  Globalworth 
is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics . Sustainalytics 
view s Globalworth ’s allocation and impact reporting as aligned with 
market practice.  ","10 GWI, “Globalworth Real Estate Investments Ltd. Terms ff Reference and Procedures - Risk Committee”, (2018) at:

Icade has engaged Sustainalytics to provide a second opinion on its Green Bond Framework and on the 
framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement process, Sustainalytics held 
conversations with various members of Icade’s CSR, Management and Tre asury teams to understand the 
environmental impact of their  activities, the planned use of proceeds, management of proceeds and 
reporting aspects of Icade’s green bond. Following this engagement, some elements of Icade’s Green 
Bond Framework were clarified  to ensure an alignment with the level of disclosure expected  by ICMA’s 
Green Bond Principles  2017 .2 Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public and internal documents.  "," 
Conclusion  
Icade, one of the leading companies in the Real Estate Industry in terms of ESG performance, as per 
Sustainalytics’ ESG research universe, devel oped a Green Bond Framework for the future issuance of a 
Green Bond. The proceeds will be allocated towards financing or refinancing : 
(i) the  construction and /or  renovation of green b uildings (i.e. buildings that received a minimum 
of HQE ‘very good’ and/or BR EEAM ‘very g ood ’ certification , are located within 400 m of public

and  
(ii) investments in energy efficiency and energy transition projects, including energy efficiency

requirements, meaning that buildings can receive the same certification based on the fulfilment  of 
different in dicators. Sustainalytics considers that this weakness is partly overcome in Icade ’s framework 
as the company  commits to transparent report ing, disclosing energy c onsumption and carbon footprint  
on a portfolio level , regardless of the certification used. Furthermore, to be eligible for the use of proceeds 
from  Icade’s Green Bond, buildings need to achieve  a minimum of  BREEAM ‘very good ’ or HQE ‘very good’ , 
providing assurance  to investors that those assets are well aligned with green building expectations.  
Sustainalytics recommends Icade to keep striving to achieve the highest levels of certifications within 
those schemes, as certifications can be obtained with different (lower) levels of performance.  As of July  ","• Strong commitment to allocation and imp act reporting.   
Icade has a  strong commitment to allocation and impact reporting.  Icade will provide a list of the 
projects financed and an external auditor will verify annually both the allocated proceeds to 
eligible green projects and the remaining ba lance of unallocated proceeds (i.e. allocation 
reporting), as well as validate the conformity of the assets with the eligibility criteria (commonly 
known as annual compliance review).  
  
Additionally, Sustainalytics considers that the impact reporting frame work provides transparent 
impact information as well as a good insight into the financed assets. Sustainalytics is of the 
opinion that this is a best practice among green bond issuances, and aligned with 
recommendation s by the Green Bond Principles.  ","  16 
3. MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) : 
An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Green Bond issue will be credited to the treasury liquidity 
portfolio of Icade. Pending allocation to eligible projects and assets, unallocated proceeds will 
temporarily be invested in accordance with Icade’s investment guidelines in cash, deposits and money 
market instruments . Allocation reporting will be externally audited. This is in line with market practices.  ","Contribu tion of the proceeds of the green bond  to Icade’s sustainability strategy

and  
(ii) investments in energy efficiency and energy transition projects, including energy efficiency 
equipm ent projects, renewable energy production projects and e co-mobility projects.  ","In France, the real estate sector accounts for 43% of final energy consumption8 and 25%  of greenho use 
gas emissions. In light  of this , and in alignment  with France’s Paris Agreement9 pledge, the French 
government has engaged with the real estate sector to reach the government’s objectives in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, as put forward by the Gren elle Laws  and the Sustainable Building Plan10. The 
Grenelle Law 2  states that “all buildings must have their energy consumption reduced by more than 38% 
before 2020”.  The  awareness around the importance of green bu ildings and  quality certification of 
buildi ngs by independent third parties contributes to this objective of the Grenelle Law 2 . Additionally, 
the European Union has  reviewed its ‘ Energy Efficiency Directive ’ and ‘ Energy Performance of Buildings 
Directive ’, the EU's main legislation covering the re duction of the energy consumption of buildings,  and 
setting European targets for energy efficiency. Given that about 35% of the EU's buildings are over 50 
years old11, energy efficiency measures represent an important part of the required investments to 
ach ieve those targets.  
  
Given this context , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Icade’s Green Bond provides an important 
contribution to addressing priorities of France and the French Government to reduce its carbon emissions  
and impr ove energy efficiency , allowing the country to achieve European and international targets on 
climate change.  ",Sustainalytics considers that Icade ’s Green Bond proceeds wil l also contribute to meeting the se target s. ,"6 Similarly to a positive energy building which produces more energy than it uses, a construction site with net positive biodiversity observes 
marked improvements in biodiversity over time as a result of initiatives taken in key areas affecting biodiversity such as th e proportion of green 
space, the sustainable management of these spaces (the absence o f pesticides, ecological mowing, etc.), artificial night -time lighting that is not 
harmful to local wildlife, sound water management and monitoring animal and plant life. In practice, expert ecologists establish a baseline  for 
the monitoring indicators on these crucial topics and will be responsible for measuring them  over time . Obtaining positive feedback from these 
indicators , and thus improving the site’s biodiversity compared with the starting point , is the goal. This progression is what determines the net 
positive impact. Icade has already established the baselines  on several Commercial Property Investment Division sites and will measure its first 
biodiversity indicators in 2017.

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Green Finance Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Green Finance Framework  is credible and impactful, and aligns with 
the four core components  of the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Johnson 
Control s’ Green Finance  Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- Johnson Contro ls’ six categories  are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP.  
- For the “ Eco -efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and 
processes ” category, JCI intends on investing in product/ technology solutions as well as service 
support focused on optimizing water and energy efficiency of buildings . Refer to Section 3 for 
further discussion of the impacts of these technologies. Below are d etails on products and 
solutions , as illustrated in the Framework5: 
▪ Digital Solutions : Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things based solutions for 
improved environmental performance of buildings through smart data analytics and 
energy management software.  
▪ Building Automation and Controls : Integration technologies to extend automated 
control to building systems , including smart HVAC and smart lighting , to drive energy 
performance and optimize resource consumption in buildings.  
▪ Residential and Smart Home : Sensor -based controls and smart home thermostats as 
well as eco -certified air conditioning and heat pump units.  
▪ Eco -Efficient HVAC equipment : Components and systems focused on  improvement in 
energy efficiency to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings.  
▪ Distributed Energy Storage : Systems to support renewable energy generation, demand 
response, backup power, peak shaving, frequency regulation and load shifting to 
optimize energy usage in buildings.   
Examples of services and support include : 
▪ Energy demand response installations, energy performance contracting, energy retrofit 
programs, intelligent lighting infrastructure, re newable energy installation and 
maintenance and water conservation solutions.  
▪ Sustainalytics not es positively that JCI  is considering  equipment  that contain s 
refrigerants with ultra -low G lobal Warming Potential  (along with zero O zone Depletion ","According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), annual global energy demand rose by 0.9 % in 2019 .24 The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 25 issued a report in  2018 that outlined that as global 
energy demand rises due to population growth,26 shifting towards clean energy plays an important role in 
mitigating climate change and meeting the Paris Agreement’s long term goal of limiting temperature 
increases to well  below 2°C, and ideally to 1.5°C . Although the share of renewable energy in global energy 
production increased by 3.7 % in 201 9,27 fossil fuel energy still meets 70% of the global energy demand.28 The 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) states tha t the total share of renewable energy must rise to 
approximately 66% of the total primary energy supply by 2050 in order to meet the 2°C target.29 
While renewable energy generation in the United States has experienced significant growth, since 2008, it 
acc ounted for a total of only 1 7% of the country’s total energy supply mix in 201 9.30 According to the 
Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), by increasing renewable electricity 
generation from technologies that are presently avai lable, there is capacity for 80% of the country’s electricity 
to be generated from renewable energy, including through wind and solar generation, by 2050.31  
Sustainalytics believes that the use of proceeds from JCI ’s Green Financings  will have a positive impact on 
the share of renewable energy generation in the United States, supporting a shift towards a low -carbon 
economy.   
Alignment with/ contribution  to SDGs  
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving 
sustainable development by the year 2030. This  use of proceeds  highlighted in the Framework advances the

Johnson Controls International plc  (“Johnson Controls ”, “JCI” or the “Company”)  is an international diversified 
technology company that focuses on creating intelligent buildings , efficient energy solutions, and integrated 
infrastructure . The Company offers air systems, building management , HVAC controls, security, and fire safety  
solution s to customers in more than 150 countries. Founded in 1885 and headquartered in Cork, Ireland, the 
Company has a global team of 105,000 employees.  
Johnson Controls  has developed the Green Finance Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to 
issue  green  finance instruments , and use the proceeds to finance  and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, a 
portfolio of existing  and/ or future Eligible Green P rojects  across one or more of the following six categories : 
1. Eco -efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes  
2. Green Buildings  
3. Pollution Prevention and Control  
4. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management  
5. Clean Transportation  
6. Renewable Energy  
Johnson Controls  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Green F inance Framework , dated August  2020 , and 
provide a second -party opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the 
Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) ,1 and the Green Loan Principles 2020  (GLP) .2 This Framework has been 
published in a separate document .3  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent4 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s al ignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Loan Principles 2020 , as administered by LMA , Asia 
Pacific Loan Market Association, Loan Syndications & Trading Association. ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; 
• The alignment of the Johnson Control ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability 
risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, S ustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.5, which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Johnson Contro ls’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Johnson Controls  
representatives have confirmed (1) they underst and it is the sole responsibility of Johnson Controls  to ensure

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implement ed within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verifi cation: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, alloc ation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
cert ified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification crit eria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, accor ding to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from cre dit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.

Johnson Controls International plc  (“Johnson Controls ”, “JCI” or the “Company”)  is an international diversified 
technology company that focuses on creating intelligent buildings , efficient energy solutions, and integrated 
infrastructure . The Company offers air systems, building management , HVAC controls, security, and fire safety  
solution s to customers in more than 150 countries. Founded in 1885 and headquartered in Cork, Ireland, the 
Company has a global team of 105,000 employees.  
Johnson Controls  has developed the Green Finance Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to 
issue  green  finance instruments , and use the proceeds to finance  and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, a 
portfolio of existing  and/ or future Eligible Green P rojects  across one or more of the following six categories : 
1. Eco -efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes  
2. Green Buildings  
3. Pollution Prevention and Control  
4. Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management  
5. Clean Transportation  
6. Renewable Energy  
Johnson Controls  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Green F inance Framework , dated August  2020 , and 
provide a second -party opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the 
Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) ,1 and the Green Loan Principles 2020  (GLP) .2 This Framework has been 
published in a separate document .3  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent4 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s al ignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Loan Principles 2020 , as administered by LMA , Asia 
Pacific Loan Market Association, Loan Syndications & Trading Association. ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; 
• The alignment of the Johnson Control ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability 
risk management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, S ustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.5, which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Johnson Contro ls’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Johnson Controls  
representatives have confirmed (1) they underst and it is the sole responsibility of Johnson Controls  to ensure 
that the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics 
with all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has b een duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  ","2. PROCESS FOR PROJECT EVALUATION AND SELECTION  
Overall comment on section (if applicable):  
Johnson Controls ’ Green Finance Committee will oversee evaluating and selecting projects that are compliant 
with the Green Finance Framework eligibility criteria.  Sustainalytics considers the project selection process in 
line with market practice.  
Evaluation and selection  
☒ Credentials on the issuer’s environmental

JCI has developed the Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework under which it may issue Green 
Financ ing s  and use the proceeds to finance projects in six  categories namely  Eco -efficient and/or circular 
economy adapted products, production technologies and processes, Green Buildings, Pollution Prevention 
and Control, Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management, Clean Transportation, and Renewable Energy . 
Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the proceeds will provide positive environmental impact.  
The Johnson Controls Green Finance Framework ou tlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, 
allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the 
use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that the Framework is aligned with the overal l 
sustainability strategy of the Company and that the use of proceeds categories will contribute to the 
advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 9, and 11 . Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the 
opinion that JCI  has adequate measures to id entify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks 
commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Johnson Controls is well -positioned to issue Green 
Financing s  and  that the  Johnson Controls Green Finance  Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment 
with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (2018)  and Green Loan Principles (2020) . ","3 Any update of t he present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Johnson Controls . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to receive allocations related to Gree n Financings (as defined in the Framework)  but does 
not measure the actual impact. The measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects 
financed under the Framework is the responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the reali zed allocation of the proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be conside red as 
being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favor or against, the truthfulness, reliability 
or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Johnson Controls  
has made available to Sustainalyt ics for the purpose of this SPO.  
Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Green Finance Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Green Finance Framework  is credible and impactful, and aligns with 
the four core components  of the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Johnson 
Control s’ Green Finance  Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- Johnson Contro ls’ six categories  are aligned with those recognized by the GBP and GLP.  
- For the “ Eco -efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and 
processes ” category, JCI intends on investing in product/ technology solutions as well as service 
support focused on optimizing water and energy efficiency of buildings . Refer to Section 3 for 
further discussion of the impacts of these technologies. Below are d etails on products and 
solutions , as illustrated in the Framework5: 
▪ Digital Solutions : Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things based solutions for 
improved environmental performance of buildings through smart data analytics and 
energy management software.  
▪ Building Automation and Controls : Integration technologies to extend automated 
control to building systems , including smart HVAC and smart lighting , to drive energy 
performance and optimize resource consumption in buildings.  
▪ Residential and Smart Home : Sensor -based controls and smart home thermostats as 
well as eco -certified air conditioning and heat pump units.  
▪ Eco -Efficient HVAC equipment : Components and systems focused on  improvement in 
energy efficiency to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings.  
▪ Distributed Energy Storage : Systems to support renewable energy generation, demand 
response, backup power, peak shaving, frequency regulation and load shifting to 
optimize energy usage in buildings.   
Examples of services and support include : 
▪ Energy demand response installations, energy performance contracting, energy retrofit 
programs, intelligent lighting infrastructure, re newable energy installation and 
maintenance and water conservation solutions.  
▪ Sustainalytics not es positively that JCI  is considering  equipment  that contain s 
refrigerants with ultra -low G lobal Warming Potential  (along with zero O zone Depletion ","6 projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some key environmental and social 
risks associated with the eligible projects could include occupational health and safety, managing community 
relations and ensuring stakeholder participation, and effluents and waste generated in construction  or other 
proj ects executed by the Company . 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Johnson Controls  is well -positioned  to manage and/or mitigate potential 
risks through implementation of the following:   
• The Green Finance Committee , which is  established  for project evalua tion , will also ensure that  all 
projects financed under the Framework comply with the Company’s ERM program which pr ovides a 
framework for management of key risks. JCI also has specialized committees and relies on inputs 
from management groups  including the Executive Leadership Team, Purchasing Leadership Team, 
Global Sustainability Council to oversee and advise on key sustainability risks . 
• The Company relies on its ‘Values First - The Johnson Code of Ethics’ which lays down the “Human 
Rights and Sustainabil ity Policy”. This policy defines specific principles and employee 
responsibilities regarding health and safety including minimization of worker exposure to safety 
hazards, maintaining appropriate emergency controls, and effectively track ing  and manag ing  any 
safety incidents.11,12 
• The policy also states employee responsibilities related to environmental risks including minimizing 
adverse environmental impact from operations as well as implementing programs to conserve water 
and energy, and  to reduce waste.13 
• Johnson Controls follows a Total Risk Management approach to identify and monitor risks across 
five pillars focused on different risks within the organization and communicate them to senior 
management. Within this approach, the Company has  established  an Enterprise Risk Committee 
which acts as a forum to discuss risks along with their potential impact and communicate key risks 
to the Board.14 
• Johnson Controls periodically conducts a materiality assessment to gather input about issues that 
are most important to internal and external stakeholders . The feedback gathered is plotted on a 
materiality matrix to determine priorit ies  and actions taken to address these issues are summarized 
and published on the Company website.15 
Based on these polici es, standards and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Johnson Controls  
has implemented adequate  measures and is well positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social  
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All six  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP.  Sustainalytics has focused 
on two below where the impact is specifically relevant in  the  local context.  
Role of eco -efficient solutions in reducing carbon intensity of buildings  
Buildings are a significant consumer of electricity globally representing 20% of electricity consumption in 
201816 and the largest consumer in the United States , accounting for 39% of all consumption  in 2 019.17 
Residential and commercial buildings use electricity for a variety of reasons primarily including space heating , 
air conditioning , and ventilation .18,19  ","4 Potential ).6  Furthermore,  in relation to refrigerant management, JCI  adheres to section 
608 of the EPA Clean  Air Act ,7 or similar national requirements , while performing 
service, maintenance , repair and end -of-life replacement of commercial air 
condition ing and refrigeration and industrial refrigeration equipment.  
▪ Sustainalytics also view s positively  the inclusion  of a 15%  minimum improvement 
threshold for HVAC equipment .  
▪ Overall, Sustainalytics views investments planned in this category to be  aligned w ith 
market practice.  
- For the “ Green Buildings ” category, JCI will finance investments and expenditures fo r the design , 
construction , maintenance  or refurbishment of buildings that have  achieved , or are expected to 
achieve , a reputable green building third -party  certification such as LEED ( “Gold” or “Platinum”),  
BREAAM  (“Excellent” or “Outstanding”) or other equivalent local and regional certifications. 
Sustainalytics considers  the referenced certification standards as being c redible and the 
selected levels as  being aligned with market practice and having a positive impact (see Appendix 
1 for  additional details on the certification schemes) . 
- For the “ Pollution Prevention and Control ” category, the Framework allows for activities  that will 
minimize  or eliminate waste sent to landfill by JCI’ s manufacturing facilities. Sustainalytics 
notes the importance of the waste hierarchy in assessing the impact of waste management 
projects and highlights pos itively the focus of waste reduction.  
- For the “ Renewable Energy ” category, the Framework includes financing for the development, 
construction, maintenance , and operation of  solar and wind energy projects . This category 
includes power purchase agreements  (PPAs) , virtual PPAs  and energy storage systems .  
▪ PPAs financed will be long -term (at least seven years) and tied to specific projects 
which Sustainalytics considers to be aligned with market practice.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Johnson  Controls ’ Green Finance Committee , comprised of  members from the Sustainability 
Leadership Committee (SLC), Treasury, Legal , and nominated subject matter experts,  will be in 
charge of project evaluation and selection  based on compliance with the Framework  and  JCI’s 
Enterprise Risk Management Program  (ERM) . Additionally, Green Projects m ust comply with 
JCI’s ERM  program which takes into consideration environmental and social risks.  
- Based on this governance structure with cross -divisional membership , Sustai nalytics conside rs 
this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- The Finance Department of Johnson Controls will be responsible for management of proceeds 
and will allocate net proceeds from any Green Financing  to an Eligible Green Project Portfolio . 
Eligible  Green Projects will be added to  the portfolio , which JCI will ai m to match or exceed  the 
balance of net proceeds from its outstanding  Green Finance I nstruments . Pending allocation , 
JCI will hold or invest the unallocated balance of the proceeds in cash, cash equivalents  and /or 
treasury securities.  
- Based on the establishment of a n Eligible Green Project Portfolio and the disclosure of 
temporary use of  proceeds , Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market 
practice.  
• Reporting:  
- Johnson Controls intends to prepare and make publicly available  Green Finance report ing  one 
year after each issuance, to be renewed  annually and until  full  allocation  on the Company’s 
website . The allocation reporting will be don e on a portfolio basis and will include total amount 
of proceeds allocated to eligible projects,  the balance of unallocated proceeds and the amount 
or percentage of new financing and  refinancing.  The reporting will include qualitative and, where 
feasible, quantitative environmental  metrics such as  estimated annual GHG emissions avoided 
or reduced , tons of waste diverted from landfill, and estimated water savings.  ","[3, 5, 7, 8]"

 Section 3.  Detailed review  
1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
The proceeds  of the green bonds may be allocated to the following green project categories:  
(i) Green buildings : both new  property construction  (that meet or surpass the criteria for Miljöbyggnad

(ii) Energy efficiency  in the property portfolio,  
(iii) Renewable energy,  
(iv)  Sustainable water and wastewater management, and  
(v) Environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources . 
  
All the eligible categories are recognized by the Green Bond Principles as project categories with clear 
environmental benefits , and Sustain alytics views these projects as having a positive impact.  ","Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:

☒ Project -by-project  ☒ On a project portfolio basis  ","Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Specialfast igheter G reen Bond Framework is credible, 
robust, and well -aligned with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles.4 Sustainalytics views the 
following elements of the Green Bond Framework positively:  
• The eligible use of proceeds categories (i.e. green building s, energy efficiency, renewable energy, 
sustaina ble water and wastewater management, and environmentally sustainable management 
of living natural r esources ) are recognized by the Green Bond Principles as project categories with 
clear environmental benefits , and Sustainalytics views these projects as having a positive impact  
(for additional information on impact see Section 3).  
• Specialfastigheter’s Green  Buildings eligibility criterion  is based on the Swedish Green Building 
Council’s (SGBC) Miljöbyggnad cert ification scheme. Sustainalytics ha s conducted an evaluation 
of this certification standard (see Appendix 1) , and views the focus on meet ing the top level  of 
certification as a leading  practice. Additionally, Specialfastigheter maintains an environmental 
database in which i t record s all materials used  in new construction and redevelopment . 
Sustainalytics considers this to be additional evidence of the company’s leading green building 
practices and commitment to sustainability.    
• Specialfastigheter’s eligib le project evaluation and selection process involves  members from 
various functional areas of the  organization. Representatives  from the Real Estate M anagement , 
and Project and D evelopment divisions  will  nominate eligible projects to a committee, which the n 
assess es a project’s compliance with the Green Bond Framework . This committee, which includes 
the CEO and CFO  among other members of senior  management , is required to reach a consensus 
decision before proceeds can be allocated to projects. Sustainalytics  regards  the involvement of 
senior management in this selection committee to be a leading practice . 
• The management of proceeds by Specialfastighet er’s Finance department through a designat ed 
“Green Account” aligns  with the recommendations of the Green Bond  Principles 2017.  
• The framework demonstrates a strong commitment to allocation and impact repo rting. 
Sustainalytics considers  the external verification of net proceeds allocation and the publication of 
this information on the company’s website as market b est practice. In addition, the company’s 
impact reporting  framework is robust, with green b uilding  projects in particular , having a 
comprehensive set of impact metrics . These include energy consumption (MWh), energy intensity 
(kWh/sqm), absolute carbon emi ssions (tonnes),  and  carbon intensity (g/sqm ). ","3. MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) : 
The net proceeds will be credited to a ‘Green Account’ , which will be managed by the Treasury 
department at Specialfastigheter as part of its liquidity reserve while the account has a positive balance. 
The Finance department will be respon sible for the allocation of net proceeds to eligible projects, and in 
the event that a project no longer qualifies under the eligibility criteria , the funds will be either 
reallocated to projects and assets that meet the eligibility criteria  or returned to  the Green Account . This 
process aligns with the recommendations of the Green Bond Principles 2017.  ","Specialfastigheter  has engaged Sustainalytics to p rovide a second opinion on the Specialfastigheter Green 
Bond  Framework  and  on the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engag ement, 
Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Specialfastigheter’s  Treasury, Environment 
and C ommunications team s to understand the sustainability impact of their business activities and 
planned use of proceeds , as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of Specialfastigheter ’s 
Green Bonk F ramework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public  documents  and  non -public 
information  that has been shared by the issuer .  ","Disclaimer  
All rights reserved. No part of this second party opinion (the “Opinion”) may be reproduce d, transmitted

  ","Through consultation, Sustainalytics understands  that Specialfastigheter only purchases wood pellets 
from Swedish suppliers to curtail the supply chain emissions associated with bio mass. These include both 
small  local suppliers and larger suppliers, such as Scandbio or SCA. Furthermore, a significant portion of 
these suppliers have FSC or PEFC certifications for sustainable forestry operations, as well as ISO 14001 
environmental management verification for manufacturing operations.  Given this additional information, 
Sustainalytics is confident that Specialfastighet er has strong guidelines to mitigate the unintended

Specialfastigheter has integrated  sustaina bility  into  its broader business strategy and pursues  ambitious 
targets that often surpass  regulatory mandates . Some notable aspects  of the company’s approach to 
sustainability include:  
• All members of senior management are responsible for implementing  sus tainability within their 
respective business divisions, with the CEO being ultimately accountable  for sustainability.  
• Specialfastigheter produces an integrated Annua l Report in accordance with GRI Standards , 
further  highlighting how sustainability is emb edded within its business. In addition, the 
sustainability aspects of the report were audited by a third -party , which Sustainalytics considers 
to be a leading practice and exemplify Specialfastigheter’s sustainability leadership.  
• Specialfastig hete r is a signatory of the Fossil Free Sweden Initiative, which aims to make Sweden 
one of the world’s first fossil free welfare countries.5 In addition, the company specifies that it 
aligns its sustainability  efforts with three UN Sustainable Development Goals : 7. Affordable and 
Clean Energy, 12. Sustainable Consumption and Production, and 15.  Life on Land .  
• The company has established a comprehensive set of strategic environmental and energy targets 
for 203 0. For example, Specialfastigheter aims to have green lease s incorporated into all new and 
existing tenancy agreements by 2030.  
• Specialfastigheter actively tracks multiple environmental KPIs for its properties , such as emissions 
intensity and  total energy use, and sets targets f or improvement.  Sustainalytics reco gnizes the 
company’s continuous improvement on the environmental performance of its pr operty portfolio. 
For example, by  2016 the company  reduced the  total  CO 2 emissions of its property holdings by 
35.4% compared to 2012 levels, and aims to reach a 40% redu ction by 2030.6  
• The corporate sustainability policy  extends  to the company’s suppliers . Sustai nalytics views the

Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Specialfastigheter’s  Treasury, Environment 
and C ommunications team s to understand the sustainability impact of their business activities and 
planned use of proceeds , as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of Specialfastigheter ’s

from Swedish suppliers to curtail the supply chain emissions associated with bio mass. These include both 
small  local suppliers and larger suppliers, such as Scandbio or SCA. Furthermore, a significant portion of 
these suppliers have FSC or PEFC certifications for sustainable forestry operations, as well as ISO 14001 
environmental management verification for manufacturing operations.  Given this additional information,

Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Tritax EuroBox Gre en Finance Framework  is 
credible and impactful and aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond 
Princ iples 2018  and Green Loan Principles 202 1. This assessment is based on the 
following:  
  The eligible categor ies  for the use of proceeds  – 
Green Buildings , Renewable Energy , and Energy Efficiency  – are  
aligned with those recognized by the Gr een Bond Pri nciples  2018  and 
the Green Lo an Principles 202 1. Sustainalytics considers that 
financing projects in the eligible categories  will lead to positive 
environmental impacts and advance the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals , specifically SDG 7 and 9.  
  Tritax EuroBox has designated 
the Green Finance Committee to act on its behalf in oversee ing  
project evaluation  and selection , and ensur ing  that selected assets or 
projects comply with the eligibility criteria. Sustainaly tics considers 
the project selection process in li ne with market practice . 
  Tritax EuroBox will manage net 
proceeds on a portfolio basis . The Company 's Finance team  will 
ensure there is an excess of  Eligible Green Proje cts over the  amount 
drawn from any Green  Finance Transaction . Pend ing allocation, 
proceeds will be  managed in  compliance with the Group's Finance 
Policy and may be temporarily  invested in cash and/or cash 
equivalents and/or liquid marketable  liquidity instruments and/ or

credit facilities . This is in line with market practice . 
  Tritax EuroBox intends to rep ort on the allocation of 
proceeds and  associated impact metrics in its Annual Green Fina nce 
Report  until full allocation. Allocation reporting will  include amount 
raised and outstanding for each green finance  instrument and 
amounts allocated to date; the p ercentage of net  proceeds used for 
financing versus refinancing; the total amount  in the  Green Portfolio, 
along with a breakdown by project category; the remaining balance 
of unallocated proceeds: and project  and asset descriptions per each 
project categor y. In addition, the  Company  is committed to reporting 
on relevant impact metrics.  Sustai nalytics views the Company’s 
allocation  and impact reporting as  aligned with market practice.  ","8 Conclusion   
Tritax Euro Box has developed the Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework un der which it may issue green 
bonds  and loans  and use the  proceeds to finance eligible green  projects that advance sustainable buildings 
and logistics solutions  that reduce the carbon footprint of its operations.  Sustainalytics considers that the 
projects f unded by the green bond and loan proceeds are expected to have  a positive environmental imp act.  
The Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, 
and managed, and  commitments have been made for rep orting on the allocation and impact of the use of 
proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics bel ieves  that the Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework is aligned 
with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use  of proceeds categorie s will 
contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 9. Addit ionally, Sustainalytics  
is of the opinion that Tritax EuroBox has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental 
and social risks commonly associat ed with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Tritax EuroBox is well -positioned to issue green bonds 
and loans and that the Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework is robust, transparent, a nd in alignment with 
the four core components of the Green Bo nd Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 202 1. 
  ","3 Sustainalytics ' Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guaran tee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics ' Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
mea surement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the potential  allocation of proceed s but does not guarantee 
the reali sed allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as 
being a statement, representation, warrant or argumen t, either in favour or against, th e truthfulness, reliability 
or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Tritax  EuroBox  has

Sustainalytics ' Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainal ytics ' Opinion on the Tritax EuroBox Gre en Finance 
Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Tritax EuroBox G reen Finance Framework  is credible and impactful, 
and aligns to the four core components  of the GBP  and GLP . Sustainalytics highlights t he following elements 
of Tritax  EuroBo x's Green Finance Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies  – Green Buildings , Renewable Energy , and Energy Efficiency  – are  aligned 
with those recognized by the GBP  and GLP .  
- For the ""Green Buildings "" categ ory, the Company  intends to utilize bond and loan proceeds for 
the development or acquisition of properties that meet at least o ne of the following:  minimum 
BREEAM (in Use and Construction) “Very Good ”, DGNB “Gold “ or equivalent ; having an 
internationally and/or nationally recognized certification  that fall s within the top 15% of existing 
national stock such as  the equivalent  Energy Performance Certificate ( EPC ) for each jurisdiction ; 
or having an embodied carbon intensity of 300kg CO 2e/m2 or lower. With re gards to these 
criteria, Sustainalytics notes the fol lowing:  
▪ Sustainalytics recognizes BREEAM and DGNB scheme s as credible, and the levels 
selected to be aligned with market expectation. Sustainalytics recognizes that for 
certain classes of developments, B REEAM Excellent may be viewed as best practice.  
Susta inalytics considers the use of BREEAM Very Good to be aligned with market 
expectations for logistics and warehousing real estate, and in any case encourages the 
selection of BREEAM buildings that achieve  a minimum score of 70% in the Energy 
category.  See Appendix 1 for a further description of this building scheme.  
▪ Sustainalytics considers that focusing on  buildings that fall in  the top 15%  within each 
jurisdiction to be aligned with market practice and n otes  EPC ratings  as a credible 
mech anism to evaluate energy efficiency.  
▪ Sustainalytics recognizes the importance of embodied carbon when assessing the 
lifecycle impact of buildings, noting that embodied carbon emissions accounted for 
11% of total annual bu ilt environmental emissions in 201 97 and views favorably the 
Company 's ambition to account for this factor. Embodied carbon continues to be an 
emerging area of inquiry within the sustainable finance space, and at this time 
Sustainalytics does not consider there to be a recognized baseline or accepted level of 
best practice.8 Nevertheless, Sustainalytics notes that the threshold of 300kg CO 2e/m2 
specified within the Framework (i) is in line with international proposals,9 and (ii) has ","13 Use of proceeds reporting :

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second -Party Opinion: A n institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second -Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer 's adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information b arriers, will have been implemented within 
the insti tution to ensure the independence of the Second -Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer 's 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or pr ocesses relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, t ypically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the envir onmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets  may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer 's internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of re porting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green  standard or label. A standard or label defines spec ific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issu er can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond fr amework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating met hodology. The output may include 
a focus on environm ental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflec t material environmental risks.  ","[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9]"

standard construction practices. In this context, the Framework 's commitments 
regarding embodied carbon are viewed positively, and Sustainalytics highlights that the 
Company has disclosed that it will use accepted methodologies in measuring 
embodied carbon.11 Sustainalytics also notes that the issuer intends to continue 
pursuing  green building certification where relevant, which will account for emissions 
over the building 's operational phase.  
▪ Sustainaly tics views the selection of buildings within the top 15% of their local market 
in terms of energy efficiency to be in line with market practice, and highlights that the 
Company  will rely on accepted national or international certifications to support this 
assessment.  
- Within the ""Renewable Energy "" category, Tritax EuroBox  intends to finance investments and/or 
expenditures for the acquisition, development, construction and/or installation of on- and off -
site renewable energy projects.  Eligible projects includ e solar, wind, biogas, and geothermal 
projects with  life -cycle emission s lower than 100gCO 2/kWh. Sustainalytics considers this 
threshold to be in line with market practice, and further notes that biogas feedstock will be 
sourced from biomass and industrial  waste . The Company has confirmed to Sustainalytics that 
the feedstock will primarily involve food waste,  and exclude  waste  stemming from  oil and gas 
operations. This is in line with market practice.  
- The ""Energy Efficiency "" cate gory includes expenditures for  refurbishment and/or renovations 
that result in a minimum 30% improvement in energy efficiency or a two -letter  grade 
improvement in EPC  labels;  as well as investments in specific equipment, such as energy 
storage technology and ground source heat pumps  with low -GWP refrigerants . Sustainalytics  
notes that heat pumps offer an energy -efficient  heat transfer alternative to conventional 
systems , and  encourages  Tritax EuroBox to  promote robust refrigerant leak control, detection 
and monitoring, while ensuring  recovery, reclamation/recycling, or destruction of refrigerant at 
end of life. Sustainalytics considers investments that deliver the aforementioned levels of 
improvem ent, as well as the individual measures specified, to be in line with market practice.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- The Manager has created the Green Finance Committee ( ""GFC ""), as a sub -committee of its CSR 
Committee, to be in charge of project  eval uation and selection and ensure that selected assets 
or projects comply with  the Framewor k's eligibility criteria. The GFC is comprised of the 
Sustainability Lead, the CFO, and a member of the Asset Management tea m of the Manager . 
The GFC  will regularly monitor the Green Portfolio of the Company to confirm  Eligible Green 
Projects ( ""EGPs "") rema in compliant. The Manager  is ultimately responsible for  the final decision 
on approving investments.  
- Based on the establishment of the GFC and its co mmitment to ongoing review of project  
compliance , Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- The Company will manage net proceeds of any Green Finance Transaction ( ""GFT "") on a portfolio  
basis, and it w ill ensure EGPs ’ value exceed the amount of any GFT. The Treasury function of 
the  Manager will be in charge  of managing net proceeds, and a list of EGPs will be maintained 
by the Finance team.  
- The Green Portfolio may include investments in projects or assets up until 36 months preceding  
the relevant GFT. Tritax EuroBox intends to fully allocate net proceeds as soon as practicable 
and no later than 18 months following issuance. Pending allocation, net proceeds will be 
managed by the Company 's Finance  fun ction and unallocated proceeds will be temporarily 
invested in cash , cash equivalents  and/or liquid marketable liquidity instruments, in compliance 
with the Company 's Finance policy,  and/or used for the temporary repayment of debt  under the 
existing revolv ing credit facilities . 
- In case the Company  disposes of buildings financed by the GFT, or any EGPs are no longer  
eligible,  the Company  will substitute such projects or assets as soon as is practicable.  ","8 Conclusion   
Tritax Euro Box has developed the Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework un der which it may issue green 
bonds  and loans  and use the  proceeds to finance eligible green  projects that advance sustainable buildings 
and logistics solutions  that reduce the carbon footprint of its operations.  Sustainalytics considers that the 
projects f unded by the green bond and loan proceeds are expected to have  a positive environmental imp act.  
The Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, 
and managed, and  commitments have been made for rep orting on the allocation and impact of the use of 
proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics bel ieves  that the Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework is aligned 
with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use  of proceeds categorie s will 
contribute to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 9. Addit ionally, Sustainalytics  
is of the opinion that Tritax EuroBox has adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental 
and social risks commonly associat ed with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that Tritax EuroBox is well -positioned to issue green bonds 
and loans and that the Tritax EuroBox Gr een Finance Framework is robust, transparent, a nd in alignment with 
the four core components of the Green Bo nd Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 202 1.

Vesteda  Green Finance  Framework   
  
Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the  Vesteda Green Finance  Framework is credible 
and impactful and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 
2018  and Green Loan Principles 2018 . This assessment is based on the following:   
  The eligible categor y for the use of proceeds is 
aligned with the categories  recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples  
and Green Loan Principles . Sustainalytics is of the opinion that  
investments  in green  building s and energy efficiency improvements 
in the residential real estate market in the Netherlands will lead to 
positive environmental impacts and advance the UN Sustainable 
Development Goal s (7) Affordable and Clean Energy and  (11) 
Sustainabl e Cities and Communities.  
  Vesteda has established a 
Green Finance Framework Group composed of company managers 
to carry out the evaluation and selection process. On at least an 
annual basis the group will evaluate existing and potential eligible 
assets to determine whether they me et the framework criteria. Eligible 
assets will be added to the portfolio and on a quarterly basis a 
compliance report will be developed by the Treasurer  and sent to 
Vesteda’s Risk Committee to verify compliance.  This is aligned with 
market practice.  
  Vesteda’s Treasurer  will manage 
proceeds on a portfolio basis. Pending full allocation of proceeds, 
unallocated funds will be managed according to treasury criteria. If 
asse ts are no longer eligible, Vesteda will remove the asset from the 
portfolio and  will aim to replace it as soon as feasible. This is aligned 
with market practice.  
  Vesteda intends to prepare an investor  report  on 
allocation of proceeds on an annual basis until full allocation. The 
report will include the allocation of proceeds to the portfolio of eligible 
assets , including a breakdown of allocation to specific use of 
proceeds catego ries; the total outstanding volume of green finance 
instruments issued under the framework , the share of financing and 
refinancing and average lookback period ; and, if necessary, the total 
unallocated amount. In addition,  Vesteda is committed to reporting  on 
relevant impact metrics . Vesteda’s  allocation and impact reporting a re 
aligned with market practice.  ","Contribution of framework to Vesteda’s  sustainabilit y strategy  
Vesteda  has developed a  “vision framework ”, consisting of a purpose, mission, vision and core values . This 
framework identifies  improving the quality and sustainability of the company portfolio as a key priority in the 
business strategy.6 Part of this priority encompasses the company’s commitment to outperform the Dutch 
government’s Energy agreement by investing into energy efficiency and renewable energy for the residential 
real estate portfolio.6 Vesteda’s objective is to reduce the consumption of energy and water , as well as  
reducing CO ₂ emissions. The company has established targets for building EPC label performance and by the 
end of 2020 at least 80% of Vesteda’s homes will have an EPC label of A, B, or C , no more than 20% will 
have a D label , and there will be zero E, F, or G labels .6 As of 2015, the average energy label in the 
Netherlands was C.12 In 2018, Vesteda reported energy performance improvements in 1,474 units and is 
making steady progress towards their 2020 goal with 84.3% of homes having an A, B, or C label, 9.6% with 
D and 6. 1% with E, F, G.6 By targeting the more inefficient housing stock with the proceeds of green finance 
instruments  for energy performance improvement , Ve steda will continue to make progress towards their 2020 
goal.  
In 2017, Vesteda applied for a  renewable energy grant to expand the capacity of solar panels and was 
awarded a subsidy by the Dutch government to install panels on eight complexes.6 As of 2018, panels have 
been installed on two complexes and the other six are currently in progress, the total amount of panels installed 
will be 1,476.6 Sustainalytics views positively this initiative and the reporting of progress .  
Based on the above points , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that by using the proceeds of green finance 
instruments  to invest in improving the environmental performance of  the company’s residential real estate 
portfolio, Vesteda’s Green Finance Framework will have a meaningful contribution to the company’s 
sustainability targets.  
Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with  the projects  
Overall, Sustainalytics acknowledges that financing improvements in green building assets  has a positive 
impact. However, as with any infrastructure development project, environmental and social risks are present, 
including the risk to worke r and tenant  health and safety as well as those related to stakeholder engagement. 
Workers can be exposed to particulate matter (e.g. asbestos in old buildings), fire hazards, heavy equipment 
                                              
5 The Framework specifies that the “average lookback period is the average number years prior to the year of iss uance when buildings became eligible.”

Conclusion  
Vesteda’s Green Finance Framework will contribute to the company’s sustainability goals by helping to reduce 
the overall environmental footprint of the company’s residential building stock. The proceeds of green  bonds  
and loans  will finance low -carbon buil dings and buildings which have made a significant improvement in 
energy efficiency following the installation of  improved building i nsolation, energy -efficient glazing for windows, 
and high -efficiency water boilers  and renewable energy upgrades via the ins tallation of solar panels. In 
addition to contributing to the company’s sustainability targets, these improvements will further contribute to 
the Netherlands’ national climate targets as well as the UN SDGs, as shown above . Finally, Sustainalytics 
consider s Vesteda’s alignment of its eligibility criteria with the Low Carbon Building criteria of the Climate Bond 
Initiative to be a robust practice, ensuring that all investments associated with green bond and loan proceeds 
are aligned with a 2-degree  global wa rming scenario . Based on this, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that 
Vesteda is well -positioned to issue a green bond and the Vesteda Green Finance Framework is credible, 
impactful and aligned with the GBP  and GLP . ","[4, 8, 10]"

impacts and advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals , specifically SDG  11.  ","2 Introduction  
Vía Célere  SL (or the “Company”)  is a real estate company dedicated to the development, investment,  and 
management of residential assets. Headquartered in Madrid, the Company has developed  more than  6,000 
homes since its creation in 2007.   
Vía Célere  has developed the Vía Célere Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to 
issue green  bonds  and use the proceeds to finance  and /or  refinance, in whole or in part, existing  and  future 
residential building ass ets that are expected to  contribute to the shift to a low -carbon economy in Spain.  The 
Framework defines eligibility criteria in one  area:  
1. Green Buildings  
Vía Célere  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Vía Célere Green Bond Framewo rk, dated February  2021 , and 
provide a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the 
Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate document .2  
Scope of work and limitations  of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories  
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalyt ics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and perfo rmance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.7.1 , wh ich is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Vía Célere ’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of thei r business processes and planned use of

representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Vía Célere  to ensure that 
the informa tion provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with 
all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant pub lic documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of th e Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engage ment 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Vía Célere . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, w hile reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achiev ed through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.   
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the potential  allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards  eligible activities.  ","Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Vía Célere Green Bond Framework  is credible 
and impactful and aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 
2018. Thi s assessment is based on the following:  
  The eligible categor y for the use of proceeds , 
Green  Buildings , aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond 
Principles 2018.  Sustainalytics considers that the eligible category  
will lead to posi tive environmental impacts and advance the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals , specifically SDG 11.  
  Vía Célere  has established a 
Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”) in charge of the project 
evaluation and selection. The C ommittee will be responsible for 
ensuring the alignment of the projects with the eligibility criteria set 
in the Framework. Sustainalytics considers the project selection 
process in line with market practice.  
  Vía Célere ’s Finance Department will 
be responsible for the management of proceeds. Vía Célere  intends 
to reach full allocation within 24 months a fter issuance. Pending 
allocation, the proceeds may be invested in cash or cash equivalents 
or used to repay existing borrowings un der general credit facilities of 
Vía Célere following the relevant internal treasury policies. This is in 
line with market practice.  
  Vía Célere intends to report on allocation of proceeds on 
its website, on an annual basis, until full allocati on. The allocation 
reporting will include the total am ount allocated to projects, the share 
of financing vs. refinancing, and unallocated proceeds. In addition, 
Vía Célere is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics, such  
as energy consumption red uction (in kWh) or emission reduction (in 
tons of CO 2e). Sustainalytics views Vía Célere’s allocation and impact 
reporting as aligned with market practice.  ","Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Vía Célere Green Bond Fra mework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Vía Célere  Green Bond Framework  is credible and impactful, and aligns 
to the four core components  of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Vía Célere ’s Green 
Bond Framework : 
• Use of Pro ceeds:  
- The eligible categor y, Green Buildings , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP. 
Sustainalytics notes that the proceeds of the green bonds issued under the Framework activities 
are expected to increase the energy effi ciency of buildings in Spai n and advance the shift to a 
low -carbon economy.   
- Vía Célere may finance residential developments achiev ing  EPC labels A, B, or C . The  
expectation is that buildings with these EPC ratings will perform in the top  15% of the most 
energy -efficient comparable buildings in the local context.4 Sustainalytics consi ders these 
criteria  credible and well -placed for inclusion in green bonds.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Vía Célere  has established a Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”) in charge of project 
eval uation and selection. The Committee comprises the CFO , Company Secretary, Head of Build 
to Sell, Head of Build to Rent, or their respective delegates. The Committee is responsible for 
ensuring the alignment of the projects with the eligibility criteria set  in the Framework. The 
Committee will meet on a semia nnual basis  to review proposed allocations.  
- Based on these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market 
practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- Vía Célere ’s Finance Department wil l be responsible for the management of proceeds. The 
Finance Department will establish a register of eligible projects and track the proceeds using a 
portfolio approach. Vía Célere  intends to reach full allocation within 24 months af ter issuance. 
Pending a llocation, the proceeds may be invested in cash or cash equivalents or used to repay 
existing borrowings under general credit facilities of Vía Célere following the relevant internal 
treasury policies.   
- Based on these elements, Sustainalytics conside rs this process  to be in line with market 
practice.  
• Reporting:  
- Vía Célere  intends to report  on allocation of proceeds on its website,  on an annual basis , until 
full allocation. The allocation reporting will in clude the total amount allocated to projects, the 
sha re of financing vs. refinancing, and unallocated proceeds.  
- In addition, Vía Célere is committed to reporting on relevant impact metrics, including energy 
consumption reduction (in kWh), carbon emission reduction (in tons of CO 2e), water 
consumption reudct ion (in m3), and amount of waste diverted from landfills (in tons). 
Sustainalytics views Vía Célere ’s allocation and impact reporting as aligned with market 
practice.   
- Based on these elements, Sustainalytics conside rs this process  to be in line with market  
practice.  ","11 SPECIFY OTHER EXTERNAL REVIEWS AVAILABLE, IF APPROPRIATE

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second -Party Opinion: An institution with environmental experti se, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second -Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented with in 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second -Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with  the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, poli cy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of  criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of under lying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or ali gnment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated  Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated G reen Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised  research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus  on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","7 Append ix

Overall comment on section (if applicable):  
Vía Célere  has established a Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”) in charge of the project evaluation and 
selection. The Committee will be responsible for ensuring the alignment of the proje cts with the eligibility 
criteria set in the Framework. Sustain alytics considers the project selection process in line with market 
practice.

occupational health and safety, community relations/stakeholder participation,  land use and biodiversity 
issues associated with buildings  development, emissions, e ffluents, and waste generated in construction .  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that is able to manage and/or mitigate potential risks through implementation 
of the follo wing:   
• Regarding worker health and safety, Vía Célere ’s Code of Conduct outlines h ealth and safety 
requirements for workers and outlines the Company’s commitment to monitoring and managing 
security measures, rules and procedures  through various health and safety training programs for its 
employees .12 For construction sites, the Spanish Law 31/9523 provides prevention and safety 
regulations for contractors.13 Chapter V of said Law regulates in detail, the rights of consultation and 
participation of workers in relation to issues affecting safety and health. In addition, the Code of 
Conduct  applies to the Company’s collaborators, including suppliers and contractors. As such, 
contractors must comply with the necessary measures to ensure worker health and safety.  
• Environmental sustainability is one of the key pillars outlined within the Compan y’s Code of Conduct 
and this code ens ures that all relevant laws and regulations are adhered to. All projects undertaken 
by Vía Célere  must comply with Spanish environmental re gulations that require public and private 
projects to ensure environmental protection and responsibility, through environmental impact 
assessments and environmental permits, under  the Spanish Environmental Law.14 Annex II of Law 
21/2013 requires that the co mpetent authority considers an environmental impact assessment 
depending on the significance of the effects of the project on the environment. In regard to  habitat 
and biodiversity, Law 42/2007 (Natural Heritage an d Biodiversity) sets out a regulatory regi me for 
the “conservation, sustainable use, improvement and restoration of natural heritage and 
biodiversity.”14 Sustainalytics considers this law and the ensuring processes to be robust, and 
sufficient to mitigat e multiple environmental risks.   
• Regarding waste management, Law 26/2007 on Environmental Liability (Environmental Liability Law) 
requires operators of potentially contaminating activities to (i) prevent, avoid and remedy any 
environmental damage; (ii) rep ort to the relevant authorities any damage (or any threat of damage) 
that it has caused; and (iii) bear the costs of remedying any actual damage. Any op erator of waste 
requires an administrative authorization  issued by the environmental  authority and each 
Autonomous Region is responsible for enforcing the contaminated land regime.14 
• The Equator Principles consider Spain to be a Designated Country, indicating that it is deemed to 
have “robust environmental and soci al governance, legislation systems and institutional capacity 
designed to protect their people and the natural environment.15 
Based on these policies  and regulations in place , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vía Célere  has 
implemented adequate  measure s and is well -positioned to manage and mitigate enviro nmental and social  
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.

Vía Célere  SL (or the “Company”)  is a real estate company dedicated to the development, investment,  and 
management of residential assets. Headquartered in Madrid, the Company has developed  more than  6,000 
homes since its creation in 2007.   
Vía Célere  has developed the Vía Célere Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to 
issue green  bonds  and use the proceeds to finance  and /or  refinance, in whole or in part, existing  and  future 
residential building ass ets that are expected to  contribute to the shift to a low -carbon economy in Spain.  The 
Framework defines eligibility criteria in one  area:  
1. Green Buildings  
Vía Célere  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Vía Célere Green Bond Framewo rk, dated February  2021 , and 
provide a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the 
Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate document .2  
Scope of work and limitations  of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories  
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalyt ics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and perfo rmance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.7.1 , wh ich is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Vía Célere ’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of thei r business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and report ing aspects of the Framework. Vía Célere  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Vía Célere  to ensure that 
the informa tion provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with 
all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant pub lic documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of th e Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engage ment 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Vía Célere . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, w hile reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achiev ed through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.   
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the potential  allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards  eligible activities.  ","[4, 10]"
24,Vonovia_External%20Review%20Report.pdf,Corporate-Real Estate,what did the use of proceeds finance?,T5,"Conclusion   
Vonovia  has developed the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  under which it will issue green bonds and use the 
proceeds to finance  and/or refinance  Green Buildings  and Energy Efficiency , Renewable Energy, and Clean 
Transportation projects. Sustainalytics considers that the projec ts funded by the green bond proceeds are 
expected to have  provide positive environmental impact .  
The Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and 
commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and im pact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, 
Sustainalytics believes that  the  Framework  is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company 
and that the green use of procee ds categor ies  will contribute to the advancement of  the  UN Sustainable 
Development Goa ls 7. 9,  and 11.  Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vonovia  has adequate  
measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the 
eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  Vonovia  is well -positioned to issue green bonds and  that  
the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components 
of the Green Bond Principles 2018.  
  ","10   
The eligible categories for the use of proceeds − Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, 
and Clean Transportation − are aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018. 
Sustainalytics considers that investments in the eligible categories could increase the envi ronmental 
performance and energy efficiency of Vonovia’s building stock and advance the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals, specifically SDGs 7 , 9, and 11.  ","2  Introduction  
Vonovia  (“Vonovia ” or the “Company”)  is a  residential  real estate company  founded in 2015  with headquarters 
in Bochum, Germany . Vonovia  owns and /or manages  approximately 490 ,000  residential units  with a total 
value of around €56  billio n across 400 locations in German , Swedish and Austrian cities , providing homes for 
over one  million people.  
Vonovia  has developed the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to issue 
green bonds and use the proceeds to finance  and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing  and/ or future 
projects that will contribute to the decarbonization of Vonovia’s building stock . The Framework defines 
eligibility criteria in three  areas:  
1. Green Building s and Energy Efficiency  
2. Renewable Energy  
3. Clean Transportation  
Vonovia  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Vonovia Green Bond Framework , dated February  2021 , and 
provide a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the 
Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate document .2  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories 
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds asses sment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.6.1 , which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Vonovia ’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting  aspects of the Framework. Vonovia  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Vonovia  to ensure that the 
information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all 
relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framewo rk and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Vonovia . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflect ing on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of e ligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  ","Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  is credible and 
impactful and aligns to the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. 
This assessment is based on the following:  
  The eligible categor ies  for the use of proceeds  − 
Green Building s and Energy Efficiency , Renewable Energy , and Clean 
Transportatio n − are  aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond 
Principles  2018 . Sustainalytics considers that investments in the 
eligible categories  could increase the environmental performance 
and energy efficiency of Vonovia’s building stock and advance the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals , specifically SDG s 7, 9, and  11.   
  Vonovia ’s internal process in 
evaluating and selecting projects is  managed by  its Green Finance 
Committee  (“G FC”) , whi ch i s chaired by the Head of Treasury and 
Finance  and comprise s representatives from the Finance 
Department, Sustainability Department,  and Portfolio Management.  
The GFC will meet semi -annually  to ensure that allocation is in line 
with the eligibility crit eria. Sustainalytics considers the project 
selection process  to be  in line with market practice . 
  Vonovia’s Finance department will be 
responsible for earmarking proceed s from the green bond s to the 
established Green Project Register and track this process in 
accordance with internal systems. Vonovia intends to reach full 
allocation within 24 months after issuance. Should any proceeds 
remain unallocated, they will be held in Vonovia’s liquidity portfolio in 
cash , cash equivalents , or other similar instruments.  Sustainalytics 
considers this as in line w ith market practice.  
  Vonovia  intends to report  on the  allocation of proceeds 
on its website  on an annual basis  until full allocatio n. The allocation 
reporting will include details such  as amount of outstanding green 
funding, total allocation  to the Eligible Green Register, the proportion 
of financing vs refinancing, geographical distribution, project 
examples , and balance of unallocated amounts.  In addition, Vonovia  
is commi tted to reporting on relevant impact metrics . Sustainalytics 
views Vonovia ’s allocation and impact reporting as aligned with 
market practice.  ","

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  is credible and impactful, and aligns 
to the four core components  of the GBP . Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Vonovia ’s Green 
Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies − Green Building s and Energy Efficiency , Renewable Energy , and Clean 
Transportation  − are  aligned with those recognized by the GBP. Sustainalytics anticipates that 
the proceeds of the bond will increase the e nvironmental performance and energy efficiency of 
Vonovia’s building stock.  
- Vonovia has define d a look -back p eriod of 36 months for refinancing activities, which 
Sustainalytics considers to be in line with market practice.  
- Under the Green Building s and Energy Efficiency category, Vonovia may rely on  third -party 
certification schemes  or Energy Performance Certifi cates  (EPCs)  for its investment related to 
the acquisition, construction , and/or refurbishments of new and existing residential buildings . 
▪ Eligible certifications are  LEED (Gold or above), DGNB (Gold or above ), and  BREEAM 
(Excell ent  or above) . Sustain alytics views these certification schemes as credible, and 
the selected levels as impactful (see Appendix 1 for an overview of each certification 
scheme).  
▪ Eligible EPC rating s are defined as  B and above  for Germany and Sweden, and A for 
Austria . Sustainalytics considers ratings of A  and  B in Sweden and Germany and A in 
Austria  to be aligned with market expectation s for residential, based on the market 
share covered by these levels  and/or the eligibility of these criteria in third -party 
accre ditations .4  
- Also with the Green Buildings  and Energy Efficiency category, Vonovia intends to invest in the 
modernization of existing residential building s that lead to a 30% improvement of energy 
efficiency compared to baseline. Sustaina lytics views the use of a 30%  improvement threshold 
as aligned with market practice  for building refurbishments .  
- Within the Renewable Energy category, Vonovia intends to invest i n the installation of  renewable 
energy systems and other technologies to impr ove building energy effic iency.  
▪ Renewable energy generation systems may include solar photovoltaic panels, solar 
thermal systems, and geothermal energy. Sustainalytics anticipates that “geothermal” 
systems will be shallow ground -source heat pumps, which ar e not anticipated to have 
substantial direct emissions, and therefore considers these technologies to be aligned 
with market practice.  
▪ The Framework also defines heat pumps as eligible products to improve efficiency. 
Sustainalytics considers  financing of h igh -performing electric heat pumps  to be 
aligned with market practice for green products , based on the lack of direct emissions 
and high efficiency values.  
▪ Vonovia also intends to invest in “innovation projects”, which are implementations of 
emerging technologies intended to improve building energy performance and/or ","Section 3. Detailed review  
Reviewe rs are encouraged to provide the information below to the extent possible and use the comment 
section to explain the scope of their review.  
1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  ","4  increase the utilization of renewable energy. The Framework cites hydrogen -based 
energy stora ge and upgrade building management systems as potential applications. 
Sustainalytics views positively the objective of these activities, while noting the wide 
variety of potential project types and therefore potential wide range of levels of impact.  
- As par t of the Clean Transportation category, Vonovia may finance  infrastructure development 
for electric or other zero -emission  vehicles . Sustainalytics considers financing infrastructure for 
vehicle electrification to be aligned with market practice.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Vonovia has established a Green Finance Committee (“GFC”),  chaired by the Head of Treasury 
and F inance,  which will be responsible for the internal project evaluation and selection process.  
The Committee is comprised of representa tives from Vonovia’s Finance Department, 
Sustainability Department , and Portfolio Management. The GFC will meet on a semi -annual 
basis  to review proposed allocations, ensure that the allocation is in line with the eligibility 
criteria, manage future update s to the Framework, and replace projects that are beyond their 
maturity date.  
- Based on the reliance on a formal committee , Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line 
with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- Vonovia will deposit the net proceeds of the green bonds in th e Company’s general account, 
where they will be earmarked for allocation to the Eligible Green Register. Vonovia’s finance 
department will be responsible for tracking this process in the Company ’s internal systems. 
Vonovia intends to reach full allocation within 24 months after issuance. Should any proceeds 
remain unallocated , Vonovia will hol d unallocated proceeds in the Company’s liquidity portfolio 
in cash  or cash equivalent instruments.  
- Base d on these measures , Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market 
practice.  
• Reporting:  
- Vonovia intends to report on the allocation of proceeds on its website on an annual basis until 
full allocation of the bond proceeds. The allocation reporting will include  the total amount of 
outstanding green bond proceeds , total amount of proceeds allocated to the Eligible Green 
Register, share of financing vs refinancing,  balance of unallocated proceeds , and description 
and geographical d istribution of projects financed . In addition, V onovia  intends to publish an 
impact report including  on relevant indicators such as level of certification, energy performance 
(kWh/m2 per year), renewable energy capacity installed (M W), renewable energy generated 
(MWh per year), and annual greenhouse  gas emission reduced/avoided (tCO 2).  
- Based o n these commitments  to both impact and allocation reporting , Sustainalytics conside rs 
this process  to be in line with market practice.  
Alignment with Green Bond  Principles 201 8 
Sustainalytics has determined that the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  aligns to the four core components  
of the GBP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External 
Review Form.  
Section 2: Sustainability  Performance of Vonovia  
Contribution of framework to Vonovia ’s sustainability strategy5 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vonovia  demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability  and has 
defined five environmental focus areas , three of  which are material to the environmental objectives of the 
Framework , namely : (i) energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction , (ii) environmental protection in 
renovation and construction, and (iii) environmental protection in the portfoli o. As part of this focus, Vonovia 
has defined the overarching  ambitions  of reducing carbon emissions in its portfolio in line with climate 
protection targets6, building new buildings with energy -optimized design, expanding innovation in renewable ","6  • As part of its occupational health and safety measures, Vonovia has established and implemented 
Group -wide occupational health and safety standards, as part of which regular safety checks are 
conducted. Furthermore, Vonovia organizes regular  knowledge sharing and training sessions on 
occupational safety for employees and has dedicated Safety officers. To ensure effective 
occupational safety mitigation at Vonovia’s construction sites, the Company works with external 
occupational safety experts  and continuously monitors the effectiveness of the implemented risk 
mitigation measures at external service providers.  
• Vonovia’s Business Partner Code ensures that all subcontractors, contractors, and business partners 
comply with legal, environmental, s ocial, ethical, and economic requirements. In addition, Vonovia 
has established a Group -wide supplier assessment system and regularly monitor’s external parties’ 
compliance with Vonovia’s Code of Conduct.  
• Additionally, the projects financed under the Framework will take place in jurisdictions recognize d as 
Designated Countries under the Equator Principles, indicating  robust environmental and social 
governance legislation systems and institutional capacity i n those countries.9 
Based on these policies, standards , and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vonovia  has 
implemented adequate  measures and is well -positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social  
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All three  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP.  Sustainalytics has focused 
on the importance of green and energy efficient buildings  where the impact is specif ically relevant in  the  local 
context.  
Importance of Green and Energy -Efficient Buildings in Germany   
Collectively , the EU’s building  sector accoun ts for approximately 40% of total energy consumption and 36% of 
CO 2 emissions , making it the single largest emitting sector of the economy .10 Around 75% of buildings in the 
EU are energy inefficient , and the current rate of renovation is less than 1% annuall y. Building renovation has 
the potential to reduce the EU’s total energy consumption by 5-6% and CO 2 emissions by 5%  if renovation rates 
increase .11 Therefore,  improving the energy efficiency of the EU’s building s tock has a key role to play  in 
achieving  the EU’s goal of  carbon neutrality by 2050  as set out in the Green Deal.12   
Being the 4th largest and most populated country in the EU, Germany plays  an important role in the EU meeting 
its climate goals.13 The operation of building s account s for 35% of Germany’s total final energy 
consumption.14 Similar to European levels, only 1.5% of Germany’s building stock is renovated each year.15 
Realizing the potential  impact  of i ncreasing  the energy efficiency of Germany’s buildings , the German 
govern ment aims to achieve a virtually climate -neutral building stock by 2050.16 In order to achieve that goal, 
Germany has defined an interim target of 67% emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.16 As 
part of the government ’s strategy for the building sector, through a combination of energy conservation and 
use of renewable energy, Germany aims to cut the primary energy consumption of its building sector by 80% 
by 2050 compared with 2008 levels.17 In li ght of the ambitions of the German government to cut emission s 
by a significant amount before 2050, there is a demonstrated need for investments  in renewable energy, 
energy efficiency , and green buildings.  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the project s financed under the Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy catego ries  are impactful and could help to reduce the environmental footprint of Germany’s  
buildings sector, as well as assisting Germany and the  EU in meeting its short and lo ng-term climate targets.  ","[1, 2, 3, 5, 9]"

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second -Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second -Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second -Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with  the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated  Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised  research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","12  Use of proceeds reporting :

Vonovia  (“Vonovia ” or the “Company”)  is a  residential  real estate company  founded in 2015  with headquarters 
in Bochum, Germany . Vonovia  owns and /or manages  approximately 490 ,000  residential units  with a total 
value of around €56  billio n across 400 locations in German , Swedish and Austrian cities , providing homes for 
over one  million people.  
Vonovia  has developed the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to issue 
green bonds and use the proceeds to finance  and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing  and/ or future 
projects that will contribute to the decarbonization of Vonovia’s building stock . The Framework defines 
eligibility criteria in three  areas:  
1. Green Building s and Energy Efficiency  
2. Renewable Energy  
3. Clean Transportation  
Vonovia  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Vonovia Green Bond Framework , dated February  2021 , and 
provide a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the 
Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate document .2  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible project categories 
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds asses sment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.6.1 , which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Vonovia ’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting  aspects of the Framework. Vonovia  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Vonovia  to ensure that the 
information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all 
relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framewo rk and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Vonovia . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflect ing on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of e ligible 
projects expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  ","5  energy,  and promoting biodiversity at its building locations.  In addition, Vonovia has been participating  in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project’s (“CDP”) Climate Change Program .7  
As part of Vonovia’s commitment to energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction s, in 2017 the 
Company set a target of renovating approximately 3% of its building portfolio every year. In 2019 Vonovia 
modernized 3.7% of its building stock, through which it achieved 16,000 tonnes c arbon reduction . As part of 
Vonovia’s 2020 goals, the Company is committed to keeping the modernization rate at  around  3% to 
continuously  improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Moreover , Vonovia aims to reduce  its 
environmental footprint by transitioning to renewable sources of energy  and decentralizing  energy supplies . 
In 2019, the Company introduced its “1,000 roofs” program, which defines the goal of equipping at least 1,000 
roofs with photovoltaic roofs  by 2021 . Vonovia erected 84 new photovoltaic systems last year  in addition to 
the over 200 systems that are in operation  and commits to expand ing  on the “1,000 roofs” initiatives as part 
of its 2020 ambitions.  
As part of Vonovia’s commitment  to reducing environmen tal impacts , the Company focuses on  low -emission, 
sustainable  construction and ecological design that contribute s to the  energy -efficient operation of new 
buildings.  Under this strategic focus, Vonovia aims to achieve  green building certificat ions  and ener gy ratings 
as a means to ensure the long -term sustainability of new development projects. In 2019, over 20% of the 
Company’s new development projects were awarded green building certifications  such as DGNB or OGNI. As 
part of its 2020 goals, Vonovia aims t o achieve energy  efficiency class A or above for 85% of new development 
projects , which is around 900  completions.   In addition , Vonovia has implemented waste management and 
recycling management systems . In 2019, the Company saved approximately 800 tCO 2 as a result of 
strengthened recycling measures  related to Vonovia’s windows replacement programs . Furthermore, u nder 
environmental protection, Vonovia places a strong emphasis on sustainable building materials and takes 
environmental  considerations into account when selecting raw construction materials . To ensure that 
environmental considerations are in place at every aspect of new constructions, Vonovia promotes alternative 
forms of mobility by installing electric charging stations a t some of their  development project s.  
As part of Vonovia’s focus on environmental protection, Vonovia set the goal for itself to become a market 
leader in designing a sustainable residential environment. The Company  has implemented measures to 
safeguard b iodiversity, reduce and eliminate harmful greenhouse gases, adapt to climate change , and use 
resources as efficiently as possible. As part of resource use efficiency, Vonovia is committed to reducing 
energy consumption in new development through  the instal lation of LED lighting and energy -saving devices , 
reducing water consumption , and increasing recycling programs .  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  is aligned with the Company’s overall 
sustainability strategy and initiatives , that the categories of the Fram ework are aligned with the three material 
environmental areas identified by the Strategy,  and will further the Company’s action on its key environmental 
priorities.  
Well -positioned to address  common environmental  and social risks associated with  the projects  
While Sustainalytics recognizes that the net proceeds from the bond(s) issued under the Framework will be 
directed towards eligible projects that are anticipated  to have positive environmental impact s, Sustai nalytics 
recognizes  that such eligible projects could also lead to negative environmental and social outcomes . Some 
key environmental and social risks associated with the eligible projects could include  occupational health and 
safety, effluents and waste g enerated in construction.  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vonovia  is able to manage and/or mitigate these potential risks through 
implementation of the following:8  
• Vonovia has implemented in-house  environmental , health and safety regulations. The Company has 
defined measures to ensure the proper disposal of materials from construction sites including 
engaging specialized subcontractors, fully documenting and analyzing disposed waste , monitoring 
construction sites  on a regular basis , and training employees on proper waste disposal.  Moreover, 
Vonovia requires through long -term supplier declarations that all materials used in construction  are  
traceable . 
• To minimize the risk of hazardous or toxic materials used in con struction, Vonovia’s procurement 
department is responsible for arranging the purchase of building materials. The Company has 
implemented TUV Rhineland Toxic Materials Management System, which ensures that all relevant 
information is recorded, documented , and evaluated.  ","4  increase the utilization of renewable energy. The Framework cites hydrogen -based 
energy stora ge and upgrade building management systems as potential applications. 
Sustainalytics views positively the objective of these activities, while noting the wide 
variety of potential project types and therefore potential wide range of levels of impact.  
- As par t of the Clean Transportation category, Vonovia may finance  infrastructure development 
for electric or other zero -emission  vehicles . Sustainalytics considers financing infrastructure for 
vehicle electrification to be aligned with market practice.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Vonovia has established a Green Finance Committee (“GFC”),  chaired by the Head of Treasury 
and F inance,  which will be responsible for the internal project evaluation and selection process.  
The Committee is comprised of representa tives from Vonovia’s Finance Department, 
Sustainability Department , and Portfolio Management. The GFC will meet on a semi -annual 
basis  to review proposed allocations, ensure that the allocation is in line with the eligibility 
criteria, manage future update s to the Framework, and replace projects that are beyond their 
maturity date.  
- Based on the reliance on a formal committee , Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line 
with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- Vonovia will deposit the net proceeds of the green bonds in th e Company’s general account, 
where they will be earmarked for allocation to the Eligible Green Register. Vonovia’s finance 
department will be responsible for tracking this process in the Company ’s internal systems. 
Vonovia intends to reach full allocation within 24 months after issuance. Should any proceeds 
remain unallocated , Vonovia will hol d unallocated proceeds in the Company’s liquidity portfolio 
in cash  or cash equivalent instruments.  
- Base d on these measures , Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market 
practice.  
• Reporting:  
- Vonovia intends to report on the allocation of proceeds on its website on an annual basis until 
full allocation of the bond proceeds. The allocation reporting will include  the total amount of 
outstanding green bond proceeds , total amount of proceeds allocated to the Eligible Green 
Register, share of financing vs refinancing,  balance of unallocated proceeds , and description 
and geographical d istribution of projects financed . In addition, V onovia  intends to publish an 
impact report including  on relevant indicators such as level of certification, energy performance 
(kWh/m2 per year), renewable energy capacity installed (M W), renewable energy generated 
(MWh per year), and annual greenhouse  gas emission reduced/avoided (tCO 2).  
- Based o n these commitments  to both impact and allocation reporting , Sustainalytics conside rs 
this process  to be in line with market practice.  
Alignment with Green Bond  Principles 201 8 
Sustainalytics has determined that the Vonovia Green Bond Framework  aligns to the four core components  
of the GBP . For detailed information please refer to Appendix 1: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External 
Review Form.  
Section 2: Sustainability  Performance of Vonovia  
Contribution of framework to Vonovia ’s sustainability strategy5 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vonovia  demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability  and has 
defined five environmental focus areas , three of  which are material to the environmental objectives of the 
Framework , namely : (i) energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction , (ii) environmental protection in 
renovation and construction, and (iii) environmental protection in the portfoli o. As part of this focus, Vonovia 
has defined the overarching  ambitions  of reducing carbon emissions in its portfolio in line with climate 
protection targets6, building new buildings with energy -optimized design, expanding innovation in renewable ","6  • As part of its occupational health and safety measures, Vonovia has established and implemented 
Group -wide occupational health and safety standards, as part of which regular safety checks are 
conducted. Furthermore, Vonovia organizes regular  knowledge sharing and training sessions on 
occupational safety for employees and has dedicated Safety officers. To ensure effective 
occupational safety mitigation at Vonovia’s construction sites, the Company works with external 
occupational safety experts  and continuously monitors the effectiveness of the implemented risk 
mitigation measures at external service providers.  
• Vonovia’s Business Partner Code ensures that all subcontractors, contractors, and business partners 
comply with legal, environmental, s ocial, ethical, and economic requirements. In addition, Vonovia 
has established a Group -wide supplier assessment system and regularly monitor’s external parties’ 
compliance with Vonovia’s Code of Conduct.  
• Additionally, the projects financed under the Framework will take place in jurisdictions recognize d as 
Designated Countries under the Equator Principles, indicating  robust environmental and social 
governance legislation systems and institutional capacity i n those countries.9 
Based on these policies, standards , and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Vonovia  has 
implemented adequate  measures and is well -positioned to manage and mitigate environmental and social  
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All three  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP.  Sustainalytics has focused 
on the importance of green and energy efficient buildings  where the impact is specif ically relevant in  the  local 
context.  
Importance of Green and Energy -Efficient Buildings in Germany   
Collectively , the EU’s building  sector accoun ts for approximately 40% of total energy consumption and 36% of 
CO 2 emissions , making it the single largest emitting sector of the economy .10 Around 75% of buildings in the 
EU are energy inefficient , and the current rate of renovation is less than 1% annuall y. Building renovation has 
the potential to reduce the EU’s total energy consumption by 5-6% and CO 2 emissions by 5%  if renovation rates 
increase .11 Therefore,  improving the energy efficiency of the EU’s building s tock has a key role to play  in 
achieving  the EU’s goal of  carbon neutrality by 2050  as set out in the Green Deal.12   
Being the 4th largest and most populated country in the EU, Germany plays  an important role in the EU meeting 
its climate goals.13 The operation of building s account s for 35% of Germany’s total final energy 
consumption.14 Similar to European levels, only 1.5% of Germany’s building stock is renovated each year.15 
Realizing the potential  impact  of i ncreasing  the energy efficiency of Germany’s buildings , the German 
govern ment aims to achieve a virtually climate -neutral building stock by 2050.16 In order to achieve that goal, 
Germany has defined an interim target of 67% emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.16 As 
part of the government ’s strategy for the building sector, through a combination of energy conservation and 
use of renewable energy, Germany aims to cut the primary energy consumption of its building sector by 80% 
by 2050 compared with 2008 levels.17 In li ght of the ambitions of the German government to cut emission s 
by a significant amount before 2050, there is a demonstrated need for investments  in renewable energy, 
energy efficiency , and green buildings.  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the project s financed under the Green Buildings and Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy catego ries  are impactful and could help to reduce the environmental footprint of Germany’s  
buildings sector, as well as assisting Germany and the  EU in meeting its short and lo ng-term climate targets.  ","[3, 7, 9]"

  Xior ’s internal process in 
evaluating and selecting projects is managed by the Sustainable 
Working Group (the “Working Group”), comprised of the CEO, the 
operational manager, the manager responsible for sustainability and 
a representative from the Finance department. Eligible projects and 
assets must comply  with the Framework eligibility criteria before 
being evaluated by the Working Group. Sustainalytics considers the 
project selection process in line with market practice . 
  Xior ’s processes for management of 
proceeds  is overseen by the Working Group. The Xior finance team 
will manage the proceeds on a portfolio basis.  Unallocated proceeds 
will be hold in money market instruments and  may be deployed at the 
Company’s discretion in cash or cash equivalent instruments.  This is 
in line with market practice . 
  On an annual basis, until full allocation, Xior intends to

1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
The eligible categories for the use of proce eds Green Buildings, Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Pollution 
Prevention and Waste Management, Clean Transport, Water Management are aligned with those recognized 
by the Green Bond Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 2018. Sustainalytics consid ers that the eligible

specifically SDG 6, 7, 11 and 12.  ","3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Xior Student Housing N.V. Green 
Finance Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Xior Student Housing N.V. Green Finance  Framework  is credible and 
impactful and  aligns with the four core components  of the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the following 
elements of Xior’s Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies  – Green buildings , Renewable energy , Energy efficiency , Pollution 
prevention and  Waste management , Clean transport , and Water management  – are  aligned with 
those recognized by the GBP 2018. Sustainalytics acknowledges that project financing can  
provide environmental benefits through increased energy, waste, and water efficiency in the 
development and operation of student residences.  
- Xior may  finance or refinance  the development or acquisition of  new and /or  existing green 
buildings in Belgium,5 the Netherlands,6 Spain and  Portugal .7 Eligible  buildings in Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal fall within  the top 15% best performing threshold of the total 
stock , as determined by national EPC label designations, which is positively highlighted by 
Sustainalytics. Sustainalytics notes that, in the above countries,  EPC label A correspond s to the 
top 15% of building stock. In addition, Xior may  finance or refinance  renovations and/or 
refurbishments  that achieve at lea st a  30% energy savings compared to baseline  consumption .  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Xior’s  financings of e nergy efficient  student residences can 
help facilitate the transition to a low -carbon economy .  
- Regarding Renewable energy, Xior  may  finance or refinance  on-site renewable electricity 
generation  and transmission , including  rooftop solar photovoltaic (“solar PV”) , wind and 
geothermal energy projects .8 Sustainalytics acknowledges the importance of fin ancing 
increased renewable energy capacity . 
- As for Energy efficiency projects, Xior may finance a wide range  energy efficient projects, 
activities and technologies, including  appliances,9 equipment upgrades, energy storage, smart 
grids etc.  Xior has clarified that district heating will come from residu al heat  and geothermal 
generation . While Sustainalytics recognizes that Xior 's sourcing of waste heat reduces carbon 
emissions from industrial source, Sustainalytics notes that the such heat/cooling distribution 
infrastructure may require the continued operation of facilities that primarily rely on fossil fuels. 
Therefore, Sustainalytics recommends Xior  to diversify its s ourcing of waste heat to industrial 
processes that do not extend the life of fossil fuel usage.  
- Within the Pollution prevention and waste management category, Xior may finance investments 
that seek to achieve higher recycling rates and wa ste prevention , for instance, through the 
construction of fully integrated sorting lines. Sustainalytics notes the contribution of related 
expenditure to the reduction and recycling of waste in student residences.  
- In the  Clean transportation  category , Xior may use the proceeds to finance bike sheds and 
electric vehicles (“EVs”) charging station s. Sustainalytics recognizes the importance of 
investments into infrastructure to encourage cycling and enhance accessibility for electric 
vehicles.  
- Xior can us e the proceeds from the Water management category to finance projects that aim at 
reducing its potable water consumption  e.g. through rainwater  recycling, water saving 
landscape design  or grey water treatment systems. Sustainalytics if of the opinion  that these 
projects can reduce Xior’s water co nsumption.  
- Xior has not established a lookback period for project refinancing.  ","Use of proceeds reporting:  
☐ Project -by-project  ☒ On a project portfolio basis  
☐ Linkage to individual bond(s)  ☐ Other (please specify):  ","Well positioned to address common environmental and social risks associated with  the projects  
While Sustainalytics recognizes that the use of proceeds from the Framewor k will be directed towards eligible 
projects that are recognized by the GBP , Sustainalytics is aware that such eligible projects could also lead to 
negative environmental and social outcomes. Some key environmental and social risks associated with the 
eligible projects could include occupational health and safety, and land use and biodiversity issues associated 
with large -scale infrastructure development .  
Xior outsource s the development and co nstruction of student residences to contractors, and as such is not 
directly responsible for managing potential E&S impacts of the projects financed through the Framework.  As 
such, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that  the regulatory environment in which p rojects are due to take place 
offers appropriate guarantees related to the management of potential risks through the following:  ","The Xior Student Housing N.V. Green Finance Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be 
tracked, allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and 
impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytic s believes that  the  Xior Student Housing N.V. Green 
Finance Framework  is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use 
of proceed s categor ies  will contribute to the advancement of  the  UN Sustainable Development Goa ls 6, 7, 11 
and 12.  Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Xior  has sufficient measures to identify, manage and 
mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of 
proceeds.  ","Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:

Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the  Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework   
Sum mary   
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the  Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework  is credible and impactful,  
and aligns with the four core components  of the Green Bond Principles 201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the 
following elements of Baseload Capita l’s green bond framework :

and tobacco . Industrial processes powered by fossil fuels and biomass power generation relying 
on feedstocks that contribute to deforestation or compete with food production are also 
excluded . The Use of Proceeds  are recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principles 2018 .  
o Sustainalytics recognizes that  Baseload Capital may  provide  financing for th e installation of 
waste  heat  to energy technologies  to utilize  heat  generated by  combustion engines on LNG 
fueled cargo ships.  Given that fuels  from renewable sources  are still not  commercially  viable for 
long distance cargo shipping, Sustainalytics consid ers LNG fueled  ships to be a transition 
technology  and that Baseload Capital’s investments in waste heat to energy technology can 
result in substantial fuel savings and GHG reductions  (see Section 3) . Furthermore , Baseload 
Capital has confirmed to Sustaina lytics that the technology used to convert waste heat to energy 
in this context is also viable in a scenario  when  renewable alternatives to LNG  are implemented 
on maritime  cargo ships .   
o Baseload Capital has defined a look -back period of 2 years preceding the issuance of a green 
bond.  
• Project Selection Process:  
o Baseload Capital’s process for project selection and evaluation is aligned with market practice. 
Its executive management team in cooperation with the company’s investment committee, 
which is forme d by members of the board of directors has responsibility for project evaluation 
and selection. As part of the project evaluation and selection process, research and technical 
studies are used to ensure that allocation decisions are made in conformance wit h the eligibility 
criteria and that projects comply with local market standards.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
o Baseload Capital will place proceeds from its green bond issuances into a separate bank 
account where they will be earmarked for allocation to assets a nd projects defined as eligible in 
the Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework. Unallocated proceeds from green bonds will be 
managed and invested according to Baseload Capital’s overall investment policy.  
• Reporting:  
o Aligned with market practice, Baseload Ca pital will produce a yearly report on allocation of 
proceeds and impact metrics. The report will outline eligible assets and projects financed by 
green bond proceeds, amounts invested by use of proceeds category, the amount of new 
financing and refinancing  and the amount of proceeds that are unallocated. Impact metrics

where the impact is relevant at the  local level and global level . ","As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Baseload Capital’s 
management team to understand the  sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of Baseload Capital’s green bond. 
Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  ","12 sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceed s, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external gr een standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An i ssuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless ref lect material environmental risks.  ","Second -Party Opinion

Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework is 
credible and impactful, and aligns with the four core components of the Green Bond 
Principles 20 18. This assessment is based on the following:   
  The eligible categories  for the use of proceeds are  
aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples.  
Sustainalytics considers that the  geothermal and waste heat to 
energy project s will lead to positive environmental impacts and 
advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals . 
  Baseload Capital ’s internal 
process for evaluating and selecting projects is  led by the company’s 
executive management team in cooperation with its investment 
committee, which consists of members of the board of directors . 
Research and technical studies are used to ensure projects comply 
with local market requirements. This approach is aligned with market 
practice.   
  Baseload Capital will place  net 
proceeds from  green b ond issuances  in a se parate  bank account , 
where they will be earmarked for assets and projects defined as 
eligible in the Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework . All 
unallocated proceeds from  green bonds will be managed and 
invested according to Baseload Capital’s overall investment policy.  
  Baseload Capital intends to report allocation of proceeds 
and impact metrics in a yearly report. Reporting will include a list of 
eligible ass ets and projects financed by the green bond proceeds, 
investments by eligible category, new financing vs. refinancing and an 
overview of unallocated proceeds. Baseload Capital’s impact 
reporting will cover electricity generation capacity from renewable 
hea t sources in MW, electricity generation in MW and electricity 
production. In Sustainalytics’ view , reporting on these metrics is 
aligned with market practice.  "," 
ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as informatio n barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issu er’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independe nt verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the en vironmentally ","[1, 3, 4, 5, 9]"

Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the  Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework   
Sum mary   
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the  Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework  is credible and impactful,  
and aligns with the four core components  of the Green Bond Principles 201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the 
following elements of Baseload Capita l’s green bond framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
o The proceeds are exclusively used to finance projects that generate energy from heat, including 
geothermal and residual heat from industrial processes . Baseload Capital has set exclusions for 
using bond proceeds for financing heat -to-energy projects involving  fossil  fuel  energy 
generation, nuclear energy generation, R&D related to weapons and defense, mining, gambling 
and tobacco . Industrial processes powered by fossil fuels and biomass power generation relying 
on feedstocks that contribute to deforestation or compete with food production are also 
excluded . The Use of Proceeds  are recognized as impactful by the Green Bond Principles 2018 .  
o Sustainalytics recognizes that  Baseload Capital may  provide  financing for th e installation of 
waste  heat  to energy technologies  to utilize  heat  generated by  combustion engines on LNG 
fueled cargo ships.  Given that fuels  from renewable sources  are still not  commercially  viable for 
long distance cargo shipping, Sustainalytics consid ers LNG fueled  ships to be a transition 
technology  and that Baseload Capital’s investments in waste heat to energy technology can 
result in substantial fuel savings and GHG reductions  (see Section 3) . Furthermore , Baseload 
Capital has confirmed to Sustaina lytics that the technology used to convert waste heat to energy 
in this context is also viable in a scenario  when  renewable alternatives to LNG  are implemented 
on maritime  cargo ships .   
o Baseload Capital has defined a look -back period of 2 years preceding the issuance of a green 
bond.  
• Project Selection Process:  
o Baseload Capital’s process for project selection and evaluation is aligned with market practice. 
Its executive management team in cooperation with the company’s investment committee, 
which is forme d by members of the board of directors has responsibility for project evaluation 
and selection. As part of the project evaluation and selection process, research and technical 
studies are used to ensure that allocation decisions are made in conformance wit h the eligibility 
criteria and that projects comply with local market standards.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
o Baseload Capital will place proceeds from its green bond issuances into a separate bank 
account where they will be earmarked for allocation to assets a nd projects defined as eligible in 
the Baseload Capital Green Bond Framework. Unallocated proceeds from green bonds will be 
managed and invested according to Baseload Capital’s overall investment policy.  
• Reporting:  
o Aligned with market practice, Baseload Ca pital will produce a yearly report on allocation of 
proceeds and impact metrics. The report will outline eligible assets and projects financed by 
green bond proceeds, amounts invested by use of proceeds category, the amount of new 
financing and refinancing  and the amount of proceeds that are unallocated. Impact metrics 
could include electricity generation, capacity and production from geothermal and industrial 
heat sources. Sustainalytics consider these indicators to be in line with market standards.  ","[4, 10]"

Conclusion  
E.ON  SE has developed the E.ON Green Bond Framework, under which it intends to issue Green Bonds, and 
use the proceeds to fund investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation . 
Specifically, E.ON may finance expenditures related to acquisition or development of renewable energy 
technologies, the connection of these technologies to the grid, replacement and upgrade of the electrical grid, 
smart meters, integrated on -site business and city energy solutions, and electric vehicle chargin g 
infrastructure .  ","The use of proceeds categories specified in the Framework are aligned with those of the Green Bond

reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  ","Imp ortance of clean transportation in mitigating CO 2 emissions  
It is estimated that passenger vehicles are responsible for approximately 12% of t otal EU CO 2 emissions.30 
European electric  vehicles sales increase every year, electric car “sales soared by more than 40% in the first 
half of [2018]” compared to 2017.31 However, in order to handle the increase of plug -in cars, the European 
Automobile Manu facturers Association estimates that the current number of 100,000 charging stations 
across Europe will need to increase at least 20x to 2 million by 2025.32 Currently, about  76% of charging 
stations in Europe are located in just four countries: Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK.32 A 2018 report 
published by the Euro pean Environment Agency noted that investments into vehicle recharging infrastructure 
are severely lacking and there are not enough EU member states providing economic incentives.33 Given this 
landscape, by using proceeds  of green bond(s)  to finance the dev elopment of new charging stations, E.ON 
can have a clear and tangible impact on the access and availability of charging stations for plug -in vehicles. 
Furthermore, if  E.ON strategically locates new charging stations in areas of need, they will likely have an even 
greater impact and can help reduce the disproportionate distribution that currently exists.  ","Section 3. Detailed review

Conclusion  
E.ON  SE has developed the E.ON Green Bond Framework, under which it intends to issue Green Bonds, and 
use the proceeds to fund investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation . 
Specifically, E.ON may finance expenditures related to acquisition or development of renewable energy 
technologies, the connection of these technologies to the grid, replacement and upgrade of the electrical grid, 
smart meters, integrated on -site business and city energy solutions, and electric vehicle chargin g 
infrastructure .  ","4 methodology, and considers it to directly link the green bond proceeds to positive 
environmental impacts.  
- The Framework specifies that investments in energy efficiency may be related to on -site 
business and city energy solutions. These products inclu de on -site energy generation and 
storage ,10 as well as energy efficiency upgrades  for municipal and large commercial clients . 
Energy from fossil fuels is specifically excluded . 
 Sustainalytics notes that these projects have the potential to deliver significa nt energy 
savings, and contribute to overall environmental and climate goals.11 Furthermore, the 
specific exclusion of fossil fuel power generation strengthens this eligibility criterion.  
- E.ON  may invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which Sustainalytics considers will 
support a transition to clean transportation systems.  
 Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- E.ON  has established a Green Bond Committee, consisting of representatives from 
Sustainability, Energy Networks , Customer Solutions  and Group Finance , as well as other 
relevant subject matter experts . The Committee will meet on at least an annual basis to asse ss 
project eligibility in accordance with the Framework. The Committee will also be charged with 
removing projects which no longer comply with the Framework and, on a best effort basis, 
replacing them with other assets.  
- As green bond s mature,  an equivalent  amount of the oldest assets will be removed from the 
portfolio ; E.ON intends that the initial portfolio will consist of project no older than three years. 
Sustainalytics views positively this ongoing update of the portfolio, as it prevents double 
counting  of green bond assets by ensuring that newly issued bonds fund new projects; 
furthermore this increases the additionality of the projects funded.  
- Based on the establishment of a Green Bond Committee, and the commitment to ongoing 
review, replacement, and r etirement of allocation, Sustainalytics considers this evaluation and 
selection approach to be in line with market practice.  
 Management of Proceeds:  
- E.ON will manage the proceeds of the green bond(s) on a portfolio basis, and strive to maintain 
a level of  allocation to the portfolio that matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds of 
outstanding bonds. Pending full allocation, proceeds will be held in its treasury liquidity portfolio 
in cash, cash equivalents, money market funds, or equivalent.  
- Based on  the disclosure the management approach and of temporary investments, 
Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice.  
 Reporting:  
- E.ON will provide  allocation and, where feasible, impact reporting on an annual basis  in the 
company ’s annua l sustainability report  and/ or in a specific impact report , made available on 
their corporate website , as well as ongoing updates related to major developments in a timely 
manner.  Furthermore, Sustainal ytics view s positively that E.ON will seek to obtain limited 
assurance  from an independent  auditor  of the allocation on an annual basis, until n et proceeds 
have been allocated . 
- Allocation reporting will include the total amounts invested to each category, the year of 
investments, the share of financing and refinancing, and the balance of unallocated proceeds. 
Impact reporting may include quantitative indicators as defined in the Framework, such as 
capacity of renewable energy connected, CO 2 emissi ons avoided, number of smart grid 
components installed, and number of electric -vehicle charging stations.  
                                                 
10 Sustainalytics notes that geothermal projects may be included within this category, and views best pract ice for this technology as including only those 
projects with direct emissions of less than 100 gCO 2/kWh. The Framework commits to only including projects that are small -scale or heat -generating 
only, or that are combined with other renewable technologies such as solar thermal, which Sustainalytics considers to adequately mitigate climate risks. 
Sustainalytics also notes that biomass projects may be included within this cat egory; while commitments to responsible feedstock sourcing as helping 
to limit associ ated environmental and social risks, Sustainalytics views as a limitation that quantitative thresholds for lifecycle emission s from biomass 
power generation have not been established,  
11 Examples of projects undertaken by E.ON include providing energy effic iency upgrades to a large commercial client that upgraded HVAC and lighting 
systems as well as installing electrical sub -meters resulting in a 34% energy savings, a combined heat and power plant in Sweden fueled by non -
recyclable solid waste with an annual  renewable energy output of 650 GWh, and a residential district which enables 100% of local heating needs to be 
met by ground -source heat pumps and solar with peak needs being met by electric and/or bio -oil boilers. Sustainalytics considers these projects to be 
representative of the potential environmental benefits that investments in this use of proceeds category may provide.  ","Second -Party Opinion

impactful, and aligns with the four core components  of the Green Bond Principles 201 8. 
This assessment is based on the following:   
  The eligible categor ies  for the use of proceeds are  
aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond  Principles.  
Sustainalytics considers that investments in renewable energy, 
energy efficiency,  and clean transportation  will lead to positive 
environmental impacts and advance the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals . 
  E.ON’ s internal process in 
evaluating and selecting pro jects is  in line with market practice. The 
evaluation and selection will be carried out by the Green Bond 
Committee, which includes representatives from  Sustainability, 
Energy Networks , Customer Solutions  and Group Finance . The Green 
Bond Committee is also  responsible for determining which projects 
are no longer eligible.  
  E.ON intends to allocate proceeds 
using  a portfolio approach. E.ON  will strive to maintain a level of 
allocation for the Elig ible Green Project Portfolio that matches or 
exceeds the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding Green 
Bonds , and will add a dditional eligible projects to the portfolio as 
needed . Pending full  allocation of proceeds, E.ON will hold and/or 
invest the balance of net proceeds not yet allocated  in its treasury 
liquidity portfolio.  
  E.ON intends to report on allocation and imp act  on an 
annual basis  until full allocation . The allocation reporting will include 
the total amount of investments and expenditures in the Green 
Projects Portfolio, the amount of proceeds used for new and/or 
existing projects and the balance of the unallo cated proceeds.  In 
addition,  E.ON  is committed to impact reporting using quantitative 
metrics, to be made  available in the company’s annual sustainability 
report  and/or in a specific impact report . Sustainalytics views  E.ON’s  
allocation and impact reportin g as aligned with  market practice.  ","[4, 8, 10]"

E.ON has developed a  Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of proceeds 
to (re) finance assets and capital expenditures that support the energy transition and climate change 
mitigation . Sustainalytics considers that the projects funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive 
environmental impact s.  
The Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, 
and  includes commitments for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, 
Sustainalytics believes that E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework is aligned with the overall sustainability strategy 
of the company and that the green use of proc eeds categories will contribute to the advancement of the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals 7, 9 and 11. Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that E.ON has 
adequate measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated 
with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Sustainalytics has assessed E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework for alignment with the EU Taxonomy, and is of 
the opinion that, of the Framework’s 12 eligibility criteria (across  four  use of proceeds categories),  which map 
to 1 2 EU activities, 12 align  with the applicable Technical Screening Criteria (“TSC”) in the EU Taxonomy and 
that all 12 align  with the Do No Significant Harm Criteria.  No categories were determined to be not aligne d. 
Sustainalytics  is also of the opinion that the activities and projects to be financed under the Framework will 
be carried out in  alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that E.ON  SE is well -positioned to issue green bonds and that 
the  Green Bond Framework is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the 
Green Bond Principles 2018.  ","

Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All four  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP.  Sustainalytics has focused 
below on where the impact is specifically relevant in  the  local context.  
Importance of grid investm ents for the integration of renewable s 
The development of renewable energy production requires grid access. In Europe, the electricity sector was 
developed nationally and centralized with large power plants being situated near large -scale industrial areas 
and metropolitan hubs.35 Renewable electricity plants generally have a smal ler scale of generation and a more 
diverse geographical spread.35 As stated in EC Directive 2009/28/EC, “There is a need to support the 
integration of energy from renewable sources into the transmission and distribution grid and the use of energy 
storage syst ems for integrated intermittent production of energy from renewable sources.”36  
Grid connection has been identified as a barrier to investment in utility -scale renewable energy projects, and 
represents one of the significant costs in the development of re newable energy projects, presenting a potential 
barrier to investment.37 By financing the connection of renewable energy production units to the grid, including 
powerlines, substations and other infrastructure, and developing new renewable energy capacity,  E.ON’s green 
bonds will help reduce technical bottlenecks for the European renewable energy market.  
In addition to physical interconnection, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are unable to provide 
a consistent source of energy due to natural  variability in weather conditions, which can be characterized as 
an intermittent generation profile.38,39 One of the important technologies for addressing this challenge is smart 
grid.40 Smart grids actively monitor energy flows and adjust to changes in s upply and demand, through 
increased communication, more efficient transmission routing, improved demand management, and other 
technologies.40 Smart gri ds can assist in the integration of renewable energy, and the EU has set a target of 
replacing 80% of electricity meters with smart meters by 2020.40 E.ON has access to approximately 50 million 
customers across Europe, the company has demonstrated its ability to improve energy networks and has a 
vision for decentralizing the energy sector. By investing in grid modernization, E.ON’s green bonds will suppo rt 
the greater adoption of renewable energy in the markets it serves.  
Impact of energy storage  
Energy storage has been a historical impediment to increasing the capacity and efficiency of renewable 
energy systems.41 In response to an intermittent generation profile, energy storage can mitigate volatility in ","

Appendix 1: Approach to Assessing Alignment with the EU Taxonomy  
Approach to Alignment Assessment  
Sustainalytics has assessed each of the eligible green use of proceeds criteria in the Framework against the criteria for the relevant NACE49 activity in the EU 
Taxonomy. This appendix describes Sustainalytics’ process and presents the outcome of its assessment of alignment with the Taxonomy’s applicable Technical 
Screening Criteria (TSC) and Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria. Sustainalytics’ assessment involves two steps:  
1. Mapping Framework Criteria to Activities in the EU Taxonomy  
The initial step in Sustainalytics’ assessment process involves mapping each criterion in the Framework to a relevant and app licable NACE activity in the EU 
Taxonomy. Note that each Framework criterion may be relevant and applicable to more than one NACE a ctivity and vice versa.  Sustainalytics recognizes that some 
Framework criteria relate to projects that do not map well to a NACE activity. In such cases Sustainalytics has mapped to the  NACE activity that is most relevant 
with respect to the primary envir onmental objective and impacts.  
In some cases, the Framework criteria cannot be mapped to an activity in the EU Taxonomy, as some activities are not yet cove red by the Taxonomy, and some 
categories which are traditionally included in green bonds may not be associated with a specific econ omic activity. While recognizing that financing projects in these 
areas may still have environmental benefits, Sustainalytics has not assessed these criteria for alignment.  
The outcome of Sustainalytics’ mapping process for the E.ON’s Framework is shown i n Table 2 below.  
2. Determining Alignment with EU Taxonomy Criteria  
The second ste p in Sustainalytics’ process is to determine the alignment of each criterion with relevant criteria in the EU Taxonomy. Align ment with the TSC and 
DNSH criteria is usually ba sed on the specific criteria contained in the issuer’s Framework, and may in many cases (especially DNSH criteria) also be ba sed on 
management systems and processes and/or regulatory compliance. To assess alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards  Sustainalytics has 
conducted an assessment of policies, management systems and processes applicable to the use of proceeds, as well as examining  the regulatory context in the 
geographical location in which the issuer will finance activities and projects. (This assessment is included in Section 2, above.)  
In cases where the Framework criteria describe projects which are intended to advance EU environmental objectives other than Climate Mitigation or Climate 
Adaptation, the Taxonomy does not include relevant  TSC. In these cases, Sustainalytics has assessed the activity for alignment with the DNSH criteria across all 
objectives.  
Sustainalytics’ detailed assessment of alignment is provided in Appendix 2.  ","2 Introduction  
E.ON SE (“E.ON”, the “Issuer” or the “Company”) is an energy company and utility based in Essen, Germany, 
focused on providi ng energy networks and customers energy solutions.  Following t he 2019 acquisition of 
RWEs 76.8 % stake in innogy SE (“innogy”) as part of an extensive asset swap E.ON received innogys  grid - and 
customer solutions businesses while substantially all of E.ON’s and innogy’s renewables businesses 
transferred to RWE. Today E.ON operates approximately 1.28 million km of electrical grids and natural gas 
distribution grids  serving 34 million cu stomers . 
E.ON  has developed the  Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to issue green 
bonds and use the proceeds to finance  and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing  and/ or future assets  that 
support the energy transition and climate change mitigation . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in four  
areas:  
1. Electricity Networks  
2. Renewable Energy  
3. Energy Efficiency  
4. Clean Transportation  
E.ON  engaged Sustainalytics to review E.ON ’s Green Bond Framework , dated February 2021 , and provide a 
Second -Party Opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the Green Bond 
Principles 201 8 (GBP) ,1 and the relevant criteria in the EU Taxonomy.2 This Framework has been published in 
a separate document .3 E.ON’s 202 1 Framework updates and replaces both its 2019 Green Bond Framework, 
for which Sustainalytics provided a previous  Second -Party Opinion,4 as well as  the innogy 2017 Green Bond 
Framework , where applicable . E.ON has confirmed to Sustainalytics  that all outsta nding bonds issued by E.ON 
and  previously issued by  innogy  Finance B.V.5, as well as all future bonds will be governed by the current 
Framework.

As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalyti cs assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The Framework’s alignment with the EU Taxonomy;  
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of  the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1.6 , which is 
informed by market practi ce and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of E.ON ’s management 
team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as

and  previously issued by  innogy  Finance B.V.5, as well as all future bonds will be governed by the current 
Framework.  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent6 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalyti cs assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as administered by ICMA ; 
• The Framework’s alignment with the EU Taxonomy;  
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of  the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk

-  E.ON  will manage the proceeds of the green bond(s) on a portfolio basis and strive to maintain 
a level of allocation to the portfolio that matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds of 
outstanding bonds  within  a timeframe of 24 months after issuance . Pendi ng full allocation, 
proceeds will be held in its treasury liquidity portfolio in cash, cash equivalents, money market 
funds, or equivalent.   
▪ Outstanding bonds include both instruments issued under the 2021 Framework, as well 
as previous  labelled green bond s issued by E.ON or innogy. As E.ON’s management of 
proceeds approach is on a portfolio basis, the Company will ensure that its green 
portfolio matches or exceeds the value of all outstanding bonds.   
- The Committee will monitor the Eligible Green Portfolio  and will remove any project that no 
longer complies with the Eligibility  Criteria or that have been disposed of, and it will replace them 
as soon as reasonably  practicable.  Sustainalytics views positively this ongoing update of the 
portfolio, as it prevents double counting of green bond assets by ensuring that newly issued 
bonds fund new projects.  
- Based on the disclosure the management approach and of temporary investments, 
Sustainalytics considers this to be in line with market practice.  
• Reportin g: 
- E.ON will provide allocation and, where feasible, impact reporting on an annual basis in the 
Company’s annual sustainability report made available on their corporate website, as well as 
ongoing updates related to major developments in a timely manner.   
- Allocation reporting will include the total amounts invested to each category  and subcategory  
level; mapping of the EU Environmental Objectives pursued by the assets ; the amount and/or 
percent age  of new and existing projects; the (share of financing and refinancing) ; the 
geographical distribution of assets ; breakdown of the Eligible Green Portfolio by nature of what 
is being financed (assets, Capex); the balance of unallocated proceeds (if any); a nd a statement 
of alignment with the EU Green Bond Standard . 
- Impact reporting may include quantitative indicators as defined in the Framework, such as  
capacity of renewable energy connected, CO 2 emissions avoided, number of smart grid 
components installed,  and number of electric  vehicle charging stations.  
- Based on  the commitment to allocation reporting and the intention to provide impact reporting,  
including quantitative indicators,  Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market 
practice.  
Alignment with the EU Taxonomy  
Sustainalytics has assessed each of the Framework’s eligible green use of proceeds criteria against the 
relevant criteria in the EU Taxonomy and determined their alignment with each of th e Taxonomy’s three sets 
of requirements. The results of this assessment are as follows:  
1. Technical Screening Criteria (“TSC”)  
− All twelve  eligible green criteria in the Framework ’s four categories  that were assessed are 
aligned with the applicable TSC of the  EU Taxonomy.  
2. Do No Significant Harm (“DNSH”) Criteria  
− Among the Framework’s  12 eligible green c riteria , all 12 are aligned with the applicable DNSH 
criteria . 
− The 1 2 criteria assessed have a total of 44 individual DNSH criteria (across all environmental 
objectives) applicable to them, and all 44 are aligned with the  DNSH criteria.  
3. Minimum Safeguards  
− Based on a   consideration  of  the  policies  and  management  systems  applicable  to Framework 
criteria, as well as the regulatory context in which financing will occur, Sustainalytics is of the 
view the EU Taxonomy’s Minimum Safeguards requirements will be met.  
− For Sustainalytics’ assessment of alignment with the Minimum Safeguard s see Section 2 below.  ","28 Table 1 3

- The four use s of proceeds (Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Clean Transportation and Green 
Buildings) are recognized as impactful by the GBP 2018. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the  
eligible projects in these  categories will provide meaningful environmental contributions and will 
support its host countries (Ireland and UK) in transition ing  towards a low carbon economy.  
- Regarding  green buildings, ESB specifies that it will limit financ ing to buildings certified  by Green 
Buildings Schemes such as LEED (gold or above) and BREEAM (very good or above).  Sustainalytics 
has conducted an evaluation of  the noted  certifications  and considers them to be credible and 
impactful (refer to Appendix 1 for  Sustainalytics assessm ent of green building standards).   
- Sustainalytics notes that ESB intends to finance upgrades to its  power transmission infrastructure  
that will facilitate energy efficiency improvements. Sustainalytics considers activities to reduce 
transmission losses fro m the electricity grid to be impactful . Regarding impact reporting on energy 
efficiency improvements in the transmission infrastructure, ESB has defined impact metrics at the 
project portfolio level . However, Sustainalytics positively notes that ESB  confir med its intention  to 
report to the extent possible on the level of efficiency achieved for projects considered to be above  
EUR 5 mil lion  in CAPEX .  
- With regards to energy efficiency investments, Sustainalytics further notes that the Framework 
includes proj ects related to improving the energy efficiency of ESB’s commercial buildings. ESB’s 
investments in this area are targeted at displacing fossil fuel based technologies with zero and low 
carbon alternatives, as well as other technology to improve buildings’  energy performance. 
Sustainalytics highlights that ESB’s framework defines eligible projects as those that achieve an 
improvement of energy efficiency of at least 50% against the baseline, a significant improvement.  
- Sustainalytics highlights ESB’s  exclus ionary criteria that exclude financing of electricity  generation 
project s that rely wholly  or partly on fossil fuels or nuclear power .  
- ESB will finance and refinance projects that fall into a lookback period of 24 months  and the company 
commits to full al location within two years of issuance , which is in line with market practice.  
 Project Evaluation and Selection  
- ESB has established a dedicated Green Finance Committee, including  the Head of ESB’s Treasury, 
Sustainability and Strategy Areas and representati ves from ESB’s Business Units. The Green Finance 
Committee will be responsible for  reviewing the proposed projects and ensuring compliance with  the 
eligibility criteria  outlined in the framework. It is particularly notable that proposed projects will be 
subject to  ESB’s environmental risk management procedures  (see section 2) . Sustainalytics is of the 
opinion that this process is in line with market practice . 
 Management of Proceeds  
- ESB will set up a register and internal controls to monitor and track the allocation of net proceeds to 
eligible projects. ESB will allocate an amount equal to the Green Bond net proceeds towards Eligible 
Green projects . If during the lifetime of the green bond, the Eligible Projects are sold, become 
ineligible  or are  otherwise  determined to be incompatible with the environmental objectives of the 
framework, ESB will re-allocate proceeds to projects that comply with the Framework . Sustainalytics 
considers this process to be in accordance with market practice.   
 Reporting   
- In line wi th market practice, ESB commits to making available on its website,  at least annually , either 
a standalone a llocation and impact report or allocation and impact reporting that is  integrated into 
ESB’s annual sustainability repor t. With regards to allocatio n metrics , ESB will report on allocated 
proceeds, the absolute value of proceeds dedicated to new financing and  refinancing and 
unallocated proceeds . The Impact report will contain information related to Eligible projects, such as ","Section 3. Detailed review

use the proceeds to finance and refinance, in whole or in part, existing and future projects related to renewable 
energy, energy efficiency, c lean transportation and green buildings. Sustainalytics believes that these projects 
will have environmental benefits and support a transition to a low carbon economy. Sustainalytics specifically 
notes the Framework’s contribution to the company’s ongoing transition to a low carbon electricity producer 
and distributor, and, in this regard, highlights the focus on renewable energy generation and transmission. 
Additional strengths of the Framework include the use of credible third -party green building standar ds and

ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, th at is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the  institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and /or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of crite ria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment  of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label define s specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green B ond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on en vironmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","ESB h as developed the  ESB Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it is considering  the

Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that th e ESB Green Bond Framework is credible and 
impactful, and aligns with the four core components  of the Green Bond Principles 201 8. 
This assessment is bas ed on the following:   
  The eligible categor ies  for the use of proceeds  
(Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, Clean Transportation and 
Green Buildings) are  aligned with those recognized by the Green Bond 
Principles.  Sustainalytics consider s that  green projects in the areas 
of renewable energy , low carbon transport and green buildings to 
have positive environmental impacts and to advance the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals . 
  ESB has established a 
dedicated G reen Finance Committee, including  the Head of ESB’s 
Treasury, Sustainability and Strategy Areas and representatives from 
ESB’s Business Units, which will ensure compliance with the Green 
Bond Framework and oversee the totality of the issuance process. 
The Green Finance Committee is responsible for  reviewing the 
proposed projects with respect to the Eligibility Criteria and ensuring 
that the requirements of  ESB’s environmental risk management 
procedures  have been applied  to selected projects . Sustainalytics is 
of the opinion that this process is in line with market standards.  
  ESB will set up a register and internal 
controls to monitor and track the net proceeds allocat ed to  Eligible 
Projects. ESB will allocate an amount equal to the green bond net 
proceeds towards eligible green projects. The company  will  also 
strive  to reach full allocation to eligible projects within two years of 
the Green Bond issuance. Sustainalytics considers this process to be 
in accordance with market practice.

Section 3.  Detailed review  
1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
Sustainalytics is confident that the issuance of green bonds aligns with innogy’s  mission and will advance 
the company’s corporate and sustainability strategy . Proceeds of innogy’s green bond s will be used to 
finance and refinance existing and future projects that support the energy transition movement in 
Europe, and that are aligned w ith the following Eligible Green C ategories: (i) Renewable energy projects; 
(ii) Energy efficiency projects; and (iii) Clean transportation projects. The eligible green categories are 
aligned with those recognized by the  Green Bond Principles  2017 . 
Furthermore, Sustainalytics is of the o pinion that the planned use of  proceeds from the green bonds will 
have clear environmental benefits and  contribute to advancing SDGs 7, 9 and 13 . "," 
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
The proceeds of the bond will be used for projects in the following three Green C ategories:  
(i) Renewable energy projects;  
(ii) Energy efficiency projects; and  
(iii) Clean transportation projects.  ","The importance of clean t ransportation projects  
Proceeds of the green bond may also finance projects that  contribute to a reduction of emissions in the 
transpo rtation sector, such as charging infrast ructure for electric vehicles. The transportation sector 
accounts for 29% of all energy consumed in Germany12 and is one of the major contributors to greenhouse 
gas  emissions in the EU. The use of clean transportation , such as electric or hybrid vehicles, is expected 
to contribute to the reduction of f uel carbon intensity reduction targets for 2020 .13 As Germany is the 
largest European car market, there is a s ignificant potential impact of innogy ’s projects, given that the 
availabi lity of charging stations is an  important factor for the uptake of clean transportation vehicles .14 As 
of August 2017 , innogy  had in total  5,8 00 charging stations operating in more than 20 countries and the 
compan y partnered with 15 0 municipal utility partners to form the Germany’s biggest public charging 
network.   "," 
Conclusion  
innogy , a European energy company , intends to issue green bonds  to finance or refinance, in whole or in 
part,  investments  supporting the transformation of the energy system . Proceeds of the bonds may be 
directed towards  the following Eligible Green Categories : (i) Renewable energy projects;  (ii) Energy 
efficiency projects;  and (iii) C lean transportation projects.  
Given innogy ’s goal to “enable people to improve their quality of life by using energy more innovatively 
through sustainable products and services,” as well as the focus of the com pany’s business divisions, 
Sustainalytics considers that the issuance of green bonds strongly aligns with the company’s mandate and 
overall strategy. Furthermore, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the planned use of proceeds will have 
environmental ben efits  along innogy ’s value chain,  contribute to the EU 2030 Climate and Energy 
objectives , and advance  SDGs 7,  9 and 13 . 
innogy ’s eligible projects are evaluated and approved  by a dedicated Green Bond Committee with 
representatives from the business divisi ons, treasury and environment departments. This is in line with 
recommended market practice.  The Committee also oversees  the management and allocation of 
proceeds throughout  the term of the bonds.  ","Furthermore , the European Commission considers  energy storage a s a key element to enable a low -
carbon electricity system .9 In addition to energy storage solutions,  proceeds of the green bonds may also 
finance  smart grid s and smart meters , which  have the potential to offer energy more effi ciently to homes 
and buildings , and reduce energy consumption.10 Smart grids enable the use of  energy adjusted to local 
circumstances by providing energy where needed and thus reduces  inefficiencies in the network. "," 
 6 
Contributing to a sustainable energy transition and climate action  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that t he use of the proceeds will contribute to the sustainable energy 
transition movement, as well as to Europe’s  climate change 203 0 targets , including  a 40 % cut in 
greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels), achieving a 27% of energy from renewables and a 27% 
improvement in energy efficiency.5 The proceeds will also  contribute to climate ta rgets established by the 
countries  in which the innogy  operates. For example, Germany  is aiming for a 61% CO 2 reduction 
(compared  to 1990) for its energy sector by 2030 , and  to generate 35%  of its  energy  from  renewable 
sources by 2020 and 50% by 2030. 6 Within the EU, energy and transport account for 80% of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The refore,  Sustainalytics considers that increased use of renewable energy , energy 
efficien cy and clean transportation  will positively  contribute to decarbonizing  the EU’s energy supply and  
reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.  ","Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the innogy  Green Bond Framework  
Overall, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that innogy ’s Green Bond Framework is robust and transparent. 
Sustainalytics views the following elements of the Framework positively:  
• Following an  assessment of innogy ’s strategy, and of the  projects that may be f inanced with

environmental benefits, supporting increased use of renewable energy and energy efficiency 
along innogy ’s value chain . Additional details on impact are provided in Section 3.  
• Overall, given the level of social and e nvironmental due diligence performed during the 
development stage of new renewable energy plants, and the regulatory framework of the 
countries in which  innogy  operates, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that innogy  is well positioned 
to address environmental and social risks related to the projects financed by the green bonds.  For 
further details please see risk a ssessment analysis in Section 2.  
• innogy ’s business divisions may propose pr ojects to be financed by the proceeds. Upon 
submission, a dedicated Green Bond Committee , with representatives from the business division,

accounts for 29% of all energy consumed in Germany12 and is one of the major contributors to greenhouse 
gas  emissions in the EU. The use of clean transportation , such as electric or hybrid vehicles, is expected 
to contribute to the reduction of f uel carbon intensity reduction targets for 2020 .13 As Germany is the 
largest European car market, there is a s ignificant potential impact of innogy ’s projects, given that the 
availabi lity of charging stations is an  important factor for the uptake of clean transportation vehicles .14 As 
of August 2017 , innogy  had in total  5,8 00 charging stations operating in more than 20 countries and the

Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Midsummer Green Bond Framework  
Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the  Midsummer Green Bond Framework is credible and impactful, and  
aligns with the four core components  of the Green Bond Principles 201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the 
following elements of  the Midsummer  Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The use of proceeds category ( Renewable  Energy) is recognized as impactful by the Green 
Bond Principles 2018.  Sustainalytics considers that Midsummer’s Framework will support the 
expansion  of renewable energy  capacity  through the research, development, production and 
distribution of solar panel systems, solar cells and solar panel manufacturing equipment . 
- Sustainalytics has a positive opinion on Midsummer’s production  and research and 
development  of CIGS thin solar cel ls which are not only more energy efficient than traditional 
counterparts but are also more environmentally -friendly , since they do not use toxic materials 
such as cadmium .  
- Sustainalytics recognizes that the use of proceeds may be allocated to operational  
expenditures  (OPEX ) including : 
▪ the selling, marketing and installation of Midsummer’s solar panels and solar cells.  
Given the nature of Midsummer’s business , Sustainalytics believes that OPEX is 
directly tied to facilitating the installation of these prod ucts and  sustaining positive 
environmental impacts.  
▪ potential  bolt -on acquisition of  companies which relate to the selling and installation 
of Midsummer’s products.  Sustainalytics considers  such acquisition to  contribut e to 
Midsummer’s  solar energy  portfolio . Additionally, Sustainalytics has been assured 
that any possible acquisition activities would be for the purpose of expanding the 
company’s ability to deliver solar technology  and that Midsummer will only acquire 
companies which revenues stem fr om  renewable energy  at a minimum 90%, targeting 
100%.  
- Midsummer applies a 24 -month look -back period to refinancing, which Sustainalytics 
considers to be aligned with market practice.   
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- Midsummer has established an internal  Green Bond Committee, consisting  of the CEO, CFO 
and the Chairman of the Board , responsible for evaluating and selecting assets and projects 
eligible for green bond funding  accord ing to  the Eligibility Criteria.  Moreover, the Green Bond 
Committee will also ensure that green bond investments are in line with all relevant internal 
policies and guiding documents. Sustainalytics considers this system process to be aligned 
with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- Midsummer comm its to earmarking net proceeds of all bonds issued under its Framework  for 
eligible activities . Midsummer  will also  ensure the traceability of the net proceeds through a 
system whereby each expenditure will be noted in a spreadsheet and assigned a wp  account 
number . Additionally, if the total amount of proceeds from green bonds exceed the total value 
of eligible projects, the excess liquidity could  be invested according to Midsummer’s liquidity 
and liability management activities.  Sustainalytics asses ses Midsummer’s management of 
proceeds to be aligned with market practice.  
• Reporting:  
- Midsummer commits to publishing an annual investor letter on its corporate website, which 
will contain an allocation report and an impact report .  
- The allocation reporting will provide examples of projects and assets financed by green bonds, 
a list of approved eligible assets and projects, including the allocated amounts, amounts 
invested in each investment category as defined in the Use of Proceeds section and the balance 
of the green bond a ccount. In its impact reporting, Midsummer will provide data on impact ","As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of  Midsummer’s 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of  Midsummer’s  green bond. 
Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  ","Review provider(s):  Date of publication:  
  
ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s a dviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment 
of the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projec ts intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
inter nal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s interna l tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may ve rify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised 
research providers or rating agencies, according to  an established scoring/rating methodology. The output 
may include a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another 
benchmark, such as a 2 -degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit rat ings, 
which may nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","Section 2 . Review overview

Section 3.  Detailed review  
1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
Proceeds of the green bond will be used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, future and existing  
“Eligible Green Projects”, when disbursements have occurred within the 36 months preceding the 
issu ance  date , and that promote the sustainable, responsible and efficient use of Icelandic natural 
resources to produce renewable energy in three renewable energy project categories: (i) geothermal 
energy projects (with direct emissions of l ess than 100gCO 2/kWh) , (ii) hydropower energy projects (with 
a capacity of no more than 100MW and annual greenhouse gas emissions below 4.0g/kWh) and (iii) wind 
energy projects.  ","Proceeds of the bond s will be used for projects supporting the production of renewable energy in Iceland. 
Considering Landsvirkjun’s  environmental and social risk due diligence process (internal risk management 
system aligned with the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol and the Geothermal 
Sustainability Assessment Protocol , and the strong Icelandic regulatory environment requiring 
comprehensive environmental impact assessments), Sustainalytics believes that the proceeds will have 
clear environmental benefits. Add itionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Landsvirkjun’s strict 
compliance with CBI’s carbon intensity threshold s of 100gCO 2/kWh for geothermal projects and 4.0 
g/kWh for geothermal projects provide additional assurance that the company’s  eligible p rojects will 
deliver meaningful positive impact. Below, Sustainalytics provides an opinion on the impact of 
Land svirkjun’s green bond eligibility criteria, considering the local context and focusing on the impact  of 
some of the projects financed over the p ast years.  ","Landsvirkjun has developed a  Green Bond Framework2 under which it intends  to issue green bonds .

 Information reported:  
 ☒ Allocated amounts  ☐ GB financed share of total investment  
 ☐ Other (please specify):    ","Contributing to  Iceland’s  100% renewable energy production  and lower carbon emissions  
Considering that Landsvirkjun is a state -owned company and  the main power supplier in Iceland, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of the proceeds will allow the country  to continue to supply 
its citizens  and industry  with 100% renewable energy (i.e. for electricity and heating ).18 This is also one of 
the company’s commitments.  The company produces renewable energy mainly from geothermal and 
hydropower sources, which emit significant less carbon emissions than the fossil fuel -based generating 
stations.19 Sustainalytics highlights that Landsvirkjun’s hydropower projects are located  in boreal regions, 
a climate where hydro dam reservoirs emit limited GHG emissions  – similar to those of natural lakes  (4 ± 
2 g CO 2e kWh-1)20 ten  years after their construction ,21 and a fraction of the GHG emissions typically 
released  by tropical dam reservoirs .22 
Assessment of the environmental impact studies of eligible project s 
As mentioned in Section 2, Sustainalytics considers that the environmental impacts of eligible projects 
have been adequately identified and addressed. As an e xample , the Burfell hydropower Station , will  be 
expanded with an additional  100MW while emitting limited GHG emissions. According to the impact 
studies  provided ,23 the conclusion is that the expansion  activities  will have a negligible  negative impact  
on the environment  and biodiversity  as all proposed work camp areas and plant areas for the expansion 
are those that were already used during the initial construction of a power station  in 1972 . The area 
affected by the expansion is within the confines of  nationally owned land  and Landsvirkjun has been 
responsible for extensive re -forestation and re -vegetation around  Búrfell. Finishing work and mitigation 
measures will be carried out with the aim of harmonising the man -made structures with the environment.  ","Landsvirkjun, Iceland’s largest electricity company intends to issue green bonds to finance or refinance, 
future and existing  “Eligible Green Projects”, when disbursements have occurred within the 36 months 
preceding the issu ance  date , and that  promote the  sustainable, responsible and efficient use of Icelandic 
natural resources to generate  renewable energy . Proceeds of the bonds may be directed towards the 
following Eligible Green Projects: (i) Geothermal energy projects ( with direct emissions of less than  
100gCO 2/kWh) , (ii) Hydropower energy projects (with a capacity of no more than 100MW and annual 
greenhouse gas emissions below 4.0 g/kWh), and (iii)  Wind energy projects.  ","3. MANAGEMENT OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) : 
Landsvirkjun’s Management of Proceeds is performed by the company’s Finance department. An 
external auditor will review annually the tracking of proceeds and the allocation of the net proceeds 
towards the Eligible Green Projects. Sustainalytics assesses the provided disclosure and processes as 
being aligned with market practice .  ","Landsvirkjun  engaged Sustainalytics to provide a second -party opinion on its Green Bond Framework and 
on the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held 
conversations with various members of Landsvirkjun’s  management team to understand the 
sustainabili ty impact of their projects  and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds 
and reporting aspects of Landsvirkjun’s  Green Bond  Framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant 
public documents and non -public information. Following this engag ement between Landsvirkjun  and 
Sustainalytics, some elements of the  “Landsvirkjun  Gree n Bond Framework ” were clarified to ensure an 
alignment with the level of disclosure expected by the  Green  Bond Principles, 2017.3 
   
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the  Landsvirkjun Green Bond Framework and should be 
read in conjunction with that framework . ","Overall, Sustainalytics is confident that the Landsvirkjun Green Bond Framework is transparent  and 
robust, and it aligns with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. Some key considerations o n 
the  Green Bond F ramework include:     
• Landsvirkjun’s eligibility criteria targets renewable energy investments , specifically, geothermal , 
hydropower and wind energy projects . Renewable energy is  recognized by  the  Green Bond 
Principles as  a project categor y with clear environmental benefits ; 
• While Sustainalyt ics recognizes that the common threshold for hydropower projects in the green 
bond market is a capacity of 25MW, Sustainalytics views the  100 MW hydropower  projects as 
having a positive impact  given : (i) the company ’s thorough  environmental and social impact 
assessment due diligence process  that mitigates common risks associated with large hydropower 
projects, (ii)  the local social and environmental context, and (iii)  the Climate Bond Initiative’s 
opinion that  4g CO 2/kWh  is an impactful threshold to ensure low  GHG  resulting from the large 
hydropower  projects .4  Similarly, the CO 2 reduction threshold for  geothermal projects  is also 
considered impactful by the CBI ;5  
• The Process for Project Evaluation and Selection is overseen by the company’s Environmental and 
Finance Departments. Only projects executed in strict compliance with the Icelandic 
environmental regulations and the company’s internal risk management tools are eligible.  
Sustainalytics views this process in line with mark et practice ; 
• Landsvirkjun’s Management of Proceeds is performed by the company’s Finance Department . An 
external auditor will review annually the tracking of proceeds and the allocation of the net 
proceeds towards the Eligible Green Projects . Sustainalytic s assesses the provided  disclosure and 
processes as being aligned with market practice ; 
• Landsvirkjun commits to  allocation and impact reporting  on an annual basis,  disclosed publicly on 
the company’s website . Allocation reporting will include a list of Eligible Green Projects, proceeds 
allocated , and the remaining unallocated proceeds. This information will be externally verified . 
With regards to impact reporting, Landsvirkjun commits to report annually on several  metrics  
such as the newly added renewabl e electricity generation capacit y (in MW)  per project . 
Sustainalytics considers that the company’s efforts to disclose information on environmental 
impact are  in line with market best practice.  ","[1, 2, 3, 4, 7]"

electricity company and one of the largest European renewable energy producers , generating a total 
electricity output of more than 13 TWh  per year . Landsvirkjun operates 1 7 power station s in Iceland1 and 
derives over 99% of its energy from renewable hydroelectric and geothermal power plants , with the rest 
being covered by wind energy projects.  In 2016, the company was responsible for 73% of all elec tricity 
generated in Iceland.  The company was founded in 1965, it is currently owned by the Icelandic State and 
is based in Rey kjavik.  "," 
Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:  
☒ Renewable energy  
 ☐ Energy efficiency  ","Contributing to  Iceland’s  100% renewable energy production  and lower carbon emissions  
Considering that Landsvirkjun is a state -owned company and  the main power supplier in Iceland, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the use of the proceeds will allow the country  to continue to supply 
its citizens  and industry  with 100% renewable energy (i.e. for electricity and heating ).18 This is also one of 
the company’s commitments.  The company produces renewable energy mainly from geothermal and 
hydropower sources, which emit significant less carbon emissions than the fossil fuel -based generating 
stations.19 Sustainalytics highlights that Landsvirkjun’s hydropower projects are located  in boreal regions, 
a climate where hydro dam reservoirs emit limited GHG emissions  – similar to those of natural lakes  (4 ± 
2 g CO 2e kWh-1)20 ten  years after their construction ,21 and a fraction of the GHG emissions typically 
released  by tropical dam reservoirs .22 
Assessment of the environmental impact studies of eligible project s 
As mentioned in Section 2, Sustainalytics considers that the environmental impacts of eligible projects 
have been adequately identified and addressed. As an e xample , the Burfell hydropower Station , will  be 
expanded with an additional  100MW while emitting limited GHG emissions. According to the impact 
studies  provided ,23 the conclusion is that the expansion  activities  will have a negligible  negative impact  
on the environment  and biodiversity  as all proposed work camp areas and plant areas for the expansion 
are those that were already used during the initial construction of a power station  in 1972 . The area 
affected by the expansion is within the confines of  nationally owned land  and Landsvirkjun has been 
responsible for extensive re -forestation and re -vegetation around  Búrfell. Finishing work and mitigation 
measures will be carried out with the aim of harmonising the man -made structures with the environment.  ","Overall, Sustainalytics is confident that the Landsvirkjun Green Bond Framework is transparent  and 
robust, and it aligns with the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2017. Some key considerations o n 
the  Green Bond F ramework include:     
• Landsvirkjun’s eligibility criteria targets renewable energy investments , specifically, geothermal , 
hydropower and wind energy projects . Renewable energy is  recognized by  the  Green Bond 
Principles as  a project categor y with clear environmental benefits ; 
• While Sustainalyt ics recognizes that the common threshold for hydropower projects in the green 
bond market is a capacity of 25MW, Sustainalytics views the  100 MW hydropower  projects as 
having a positive impact  given : (i) the company ’s thorough  environmental and social impact 
assessment due diligence process  that mitigates common risks associated with large hydropower 
projects, (ii)  the local social and environmental context, and (iii)  the Climate Bond Initiative’s 
opinion that  4g CO 2/kWh  is an impactful threshold to ensure low  GHG  resulting from the large 
hydropower  projects .4  Similarly, the CO 2 reduction threshold for  geothermal projects  is also 
considered impactful by the CBI ;5  
• The Process for Project Evaluation and Selection is overseen by the company’s Environmental and 
Finance Departments. Only projects executed in strict compliance with the Icelandic 
environmental regulations and the company’s internal risk management tools are eligible.  
Sustainalytics views this process in line with mark et practice ; 
• Landsvirkjun’s Management of Proceeds is performed by the company’s Finance Department . An 
external auditor will review annually the tracking of proceeds and the allocation of the net 
proceeds towards the Eligible Green Projects . Sustainalytic s assesses the provided  disclosure and 
processes as being aligned with market practice ; 
• Landsvirkjun commits to  allocation and impact reporting  on an annual basis,  disclosed publicly on 
the company’s website . Allocation reporting will include a list of Eligible Green Projects, proceeds 
allocated , and the remaining unallocated proceeds. This information will be externally verified . 
With regards to impact reporting, Landsvirkjun commits to report annually on several  metrics  
such as the newly added renewabl e electricity generation capacit y (in MW)  per project . 
Sustainalytics considers that the company’s efforts to disclose information on environmental 
impact are  in line with market best practice.  ","Proceeds of the bond s will be used for projects supporting the production of renewable energy in Iceland. 
Considering Landsvirkjun’s  environmental and social risk due diligence process (internal risk management 
system aligned with the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol and the Geothermal 
Sustainability Assessment Protocol , and the strong Icelandic regulatory environment requiring 
comprehensive environmental impact assessments), Sustainalytics believes that the proceeds will have 
clear environmental benefits. Add itionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Landsvirkjun’s strict 
compliance with CBI’s carbon intensity threshold s of 100gCO 2/kWh for geothermal projects and 4.0 
g/kWh for geothermal projects provide additional assurance that the company’s  eligible p rojects will 
deliver meaningful positive impact. Below, Sustainalytics provides an opinion on the impact of 
Land svirkjun’s green bond eligibility criteria, considering the local context and focusing on the impact  of 
some of the projects financed over the p ast years.  ","Landsvirkjun has developed a  Green Bond Framework2 under which it intends  to issue green bonds . 
Proceeds of the green bonds  will be used to finance  or refinanc e, in whole or in part, future and existing  
“Eligible Green Projects” , when disbursements have occurred within the 36 months preceding the 
issu ance  date , and  that promote the sustainable , responsible and efficient use of Icelandic natural 
resources to produce renewable energy . The framework defines eligibility criteria in three renewable 
energy project categories :  ","Landsvirkjun  engaged Sustainalytics to provide a second -party opinion on its Green Bond Framework and 
on the framework’s environmental credentials. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held 
conversations with various members of Landsvirkjun’s  management team to understand the 
sustainabili ty impact of their projects  and planned use of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds 
and reporting aspects of Landsvirkjun’s  Green Bond  Framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant 
public documents and non -public information. Following this engag ement between Landsvirkjun  and 
Sustainalytics, some elements of the  “Landsvirkjun  Gree n Bond Framework ” were clarified to ensure an 
alignment with the level of disclosure expected by the  Green  Bond Principles, 2017.3

Neutral Capital Finance PLC has developed the Neutral Capital Finance PLC  Green Bond Framework  under 
which it may  issue green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, 
existing and/or future projects  for Neutral Fuels,  that are expected to provide positive environmental impact 
and contribute towards the transition to low -carbon t ransportation.  Sustainalytics considers that the project s 
funded by the green bond proceeds are expected to have  provide positive environmental impact .  
The Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and managed, and 
commitm ents have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of proceeds. Furthermore, 
Sustainalytics believes that  the  Framework  is aligned with the overall sustainability initiatives  of the Company 
and that the green use of proceed  categor ies will contribute to the advancement of  the  UN SDGs 7, 9, and 12. 
Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Neutral Fuels  has adequate  measures to identify, manage 
and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use 
of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  Neutral Fuels  is well -positioned to issue green  bonds and 
that the Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond 
Principles 2018.  "," 
Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Neutral Capital Finance PLC Green Bond 
Framework  is credible and impactful and aligns to the four core components of the 
Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based on the following:  
  The eligible categories  for the use of proceeds  –
Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy Adapted Products, Production 
Technologies and Processes , and Clean Transportation  – are  aligned 
with tho se recognized by the Green Bond Pri nciples 2018.  
Sustainalytics considers that the investments in eligible categories  
will lead to positive environmental impacts and advance the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals  (“SDGs”) , specifically SDGs 7 , 9 and 
12. 
  The Neutral Fuel s LLC (‘Neutral 
Fuels”)  investment team  will be responsible for t he approval of 
eligible projects under the Framework . The investment decision will 
involve at least one of Neu tral Fuel s’ Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer or Chief Operating Officer  (“COO”) . The company  
has articulated a clear process for evaluating projects, and where 
necessary, may rely on third -party sustainability experts . 
Sustainalytics consid ers the project selection process  to be  in line 
with market practice.  
  Neutral Fuels ’ Finance Department, 
supported by its COO, will be responsible for the allocation of bond 
proceeds per the criteria defined in the Framework. The company  
intends to  fully allocate all proceeds within 36 months from the 
issuance. Pending allocation, proceeds  may be held in cash or cash 
equivalents or invested in money market funds.  This is in line with 
market practice.  
  Neutral Fuels intends to  report on the allocation of 
proceeds on its website annually  until full allocation.  The allocation 
reporting is expected to include project -level details on the allocation 
of proceeds, proportion of financed and refinanced projects, and the 
balance to unallocated proceeds.  In addition , N eutral  Fuels  also 
intends to  report on  quantitative impact metrics , including  avoided 
emissions , and annual waste diverted from waste stream . 
Sustainalytics views the allocation and impact reporting as aligned 
with market practice.  ","12 The eligible categories  for the use of proceeds  –Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy Adapted Products, 
Production Technologies and Processes , and Clean Transportation  – are  aligned with those recognized by 
the Green Bond Pri nciples 2018.  Sustainalytics considers that the investments in eligib le categories  will lead 
to positive environmental impacts and advance the UN SDGs, specifically SDGs 7, 9 and 12.  ","3 measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the  
responsibility of the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the potential  allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustai nalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the Neutral Capital Finance PLC Green Bond 
Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opi nion that the Neutral Capital Finance PLC Green Bond Framework  is credible and 
impactful, and aligns to the four core components of the GBP. Sustainalytics highlights the following elements 
of the  Framework:  
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categories  – Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy Adapted Products  and Clean 
Transport ation  – are aligned with those recognized by the GBP.  
- Neutral Fuels has established a look -back period of 36 months for project refinancing . 
Sustainalytics recognizes this to be in line with market practice.  
- Under the Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy Adapted Products category, Neutral Fuels 
intend s to finance  capital expenditures related to  the collection and tracking of waste cooking 
oil for its biofuel operations . This may include:   
▪ Electric and alternative  fuel vehicles to be used for the collection and transportation of 
waste cooking oil.  For alternative fuel vehicles, the Company contemplates 
investments in diesel -engine vehicles that run on 100% biodiesel as well as biodiesel 
blends , ensuring that  overall emissions for the entire portfolio of financed vehicles are 
below 25g CO 2 per tonne -km. Sustainalytics notes that the market expectation is to 
invest in freight vehicles that individu ally meet this threshold, and therefore encourages 
Neutral Fuels to prioritize  the  financing of such vehicles. Furthermore, Neutral Fuels 
has confirmed to Sustainalytics that proceeds from the bonds issued under this 
Framework will not be used for  the tran sportation of fossil fuels, including blended 
biofuel.  
▪ Technologi es that support the development and use of biodiesel such as  tracking 
systems and sensors  for the Company’s  waste oil collection process . Sustainalytics 
views positively activities that divert waste cooking oil for reuse  and conside rs such 
expenditures to be in line with market practice. Refer to Section 2 fo r more details on 
the technologies being contemplated . 
▪ Activities required for the Company to obtai n certifications  such as the International 
Sustainability & Carbon Certification scheme ( ISCC ) for waste cooking oil  sourcing . 
Sustainalytics has conducted an evaluation of this scheme and considers it to be 
robust and credible. See Appendix 1 for further description of the referenced standard.  
- For Clean Transportation expenditures , Neutral Fuels contemplates  financ ing a range of projects  
related to the expansion of its bio diesel  production and dispensing capacity , including (i) the 
construction and/or deve lopment of new or existing facilities dedicated to producing 100% 
biodiesel  from waste cooking oil ; (ii) electric and alternative -fueled biofuel dispensing vehicles , 
(iii) equipment such as dispensing  pumps , sensors and tanks ; and  (iv) research and 
development of biodiesel technologies including patents and certifications.  Sustainalytics 
considers investments in this category  to be aligned with market practice and notes the 
following:  ","

Neutral Fuels  LLC  (“Neutral Fuels” or the “Company”) is a biofuel produc tion  and dis tribution company whose 
primary business is to collect  and  proces s waste cooking oil into biodiesel , to serve as a commercially viable  
replacement for petroleum  diesel.1 Headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), Neutral Fuels 
operat es biofuel production and dispensing facilities in the UAE , Bahrain and India.  Neutral Fuels has created  
Neutral Capital Finance PLC (the “Issuer”)  for the sole purpose of raising debt . 
The Issuer  has developed the Neutral Capital Finance PLC Green Bond Framework  (the “Framework”) under 
which it intends to issue green bonds  and use the proceeds to finance an d/or refinance, in whole or in part, 
existing and/or future projects that are expected to provide positive environmental impact and contribute 
towards the  transition to low -carbon transportation . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in two  areas:  
1. Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy Adapted Products, Production Technologies and Processes  
(“Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy”)  
2. Clean Transportation  
Neutral Capital Finance PLC  engaged Sustainalytics to review the Framework , dated May  2021 , and to provide 
a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework’s environmental credentials , as well as  its alignment with the Green 
Bond Principles 2018 (GBP) .2 This Framework will be  published in a separate document .3

• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1. 8, which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Neutral Fuels ’ 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Neutral Fuels  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Neutral Fuels  to ensure tha t 
the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with 
all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed  relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Neutral Capital Finance PLC . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market

ABOUT  ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second -Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second -Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second -Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with  the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of proje cts intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
inte rnal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s intern al tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated  Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may v erify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised  research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an established scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2 -degree climate change scena rio. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which may 
nonetheless reflect material environmental risks.  ","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]"

Neutral Fuels  LLC  (“Neutral Fuels” or the “Company”) is a biofuel produc tion  and dis tribution company whose 
primary business is to collect  and  proces s waste cooking oil into biodiesel , to serve as a commercially viable  
replacement for petroleum  diesel.1 Headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), Neutral Fuels 
operat es biofuel production and dispensing facilities in the UAE , Bahrain and India.  Neutral Fuels has created  
Neutral Capital Finance PLC (the “Issuer”)  for the sole purpose of raising debt . 
The Issuer  has developed the Neutral Capital Finance PLC Green Bond Framework  (the “Framework”) under 
which it intends to issue green bonds  and use the proceeds to finance an d/or refinance, in whole or in part, 
existing and/or future projects that are expected to provide positive environmental impact and contribute 
towards the  transition to low -carbon transportation . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in two  areas:  
1. Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy Adapted Products, Production Technologies and Processes  
(“Eco -efficient and/or Circular Economy”)  
2. Clean Transportation  
Neutral Capital Finance PLC  engaged Sustainalytics to review the Framework , dated May  2021 , and to provide 
a Second -Party Opinion on the Framework’s environmental credentials , as well as  its alignment with the Green 
Bond Principles 2018 (GBP) .2 This Framework will be  published in a separate document .3  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics ’ Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics ’ independent4 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which t he eligible project categories 
are credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the GBP , as administered by ICMA ; 
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds ; and  
• The alignment of the issuer ’s sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk 
management in relation to the use of proceeds . 
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version 1. 8, which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Neutral Fuels ’ 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Neutral Fuels  
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Neutral Fuels  to ensure tha t 
the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with 
all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed  relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement

Impact of use of proceeds: the importance of renewable energy in Europe  
In 2007, the EU set its 2020 Strategy7 for smart,  sustainable and inclusive growth. One of the key focus 
areas is ‘Climate change and Energy’. Three binding 2020 targets have been defined: (i) greenhouse gas 
emissions 20% lower than 1990 levels ; (ii)  20% of energy from  renewables ; (iii) 20% increas e in energy 
efficiency . This has caused a significant increase in renewable energy generation which is expected to 
continue the coming decade . ","© Sustainalytics 2016

Sustainalytics’ opi nion on the use of  proceeds  
Renewable energy is recognized by the GBP as an eligible green project category, offering clear 
environmental benefits. However, t he eligible projects under Repower’s Green SSD include projects  
developed or acquired from 2007 onwards . While the re is a clear ongoing environmental benefit  in 
continued renewable energy generation , there is limited additionality given that proceeds are  refinanc ing  
asset s that  have been in operation for a signif icant period of time . 
  
Operational Expenditures  
Proceeds  of Green SSD  might be allocated to OPEX (operational expenditures) specific to eligible projects. 
Sustainalytics considers that Repower has a reliable process to track OPEX to eligible projects, by using a 
software (SAP) that registers costs for each power plant. This register will include all O PEX  and 
maintenances procedures. Furthermore, given the nature of the projects, Sustainalytics believes  that 
OPEX will be important to maintain projects and w ill contribute to sustaining positive environmental 
impacts.  ","Repower will use the net proceeds of the Green SSD  in part  to refinance a CHF  200  million  bond that 
reached maturity and that  has also funded renewable energy investments . The proceeds of the issuance  
by Repower  will be immediately al located towards ref inancing eligible projects  (see Appendix 2) , in line 
with the book value  of each project  as per end of 2016 . Repower’s total investment made in wind  parks

related to the acquisition , development , operat ion and maintenance  of wind  park s and hydro power 
plants . Repower  has engaged Sustainalytics to provide a n external review of its Green SSD  framework , its 
alignment with the transparency and reporting requirements of the  International Capital Market 
Associa tion 2016 Green Bond Principles  (“GBP ”)2 as well as  the  Green  SSD’s  environmental impact . As part 
of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Repower’s  treasury and 
sustainability  team s to understand the company’s sustainabi lity vision and performance, the plan ned use 
and management of proceeds and reporting associated with estimated positive impacts . Sustainalytics 
also reviewed relevant public and internal documents. This document contains two sections: Framework ","Given this context, Sustainalytics considers that Repower’s Green SSD, under which proceeds will be used

security.  "," 
Conclusion  
Repower’s Green SSD  framework provides clarity regarding use of proceeds and the outcomes of the 
investments.  Repower’s Green SSD  intends to refinance the company’s investments in renewable energy,  
which  is recognized by the GBP as an eligible green project category, offering clear environmental 
benefits. In the context of Europe’s ‘Climate change and Energy ’ priorities , Rep ower’s strategy and focus 
on the development, acquisition, operation and maintenance of wind parks and hydropower plants 
contribute to important national priorities and to Europe’s tran sition to a low -carbon economy. 
Furthermore, in Sustainalytics’ view , Repower’s  approach to p resent a llocation r eporting based on the 
end -of-year  book value of the eligible assets provides increased transparency to investors.  
  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Repower’s Green SSD  is credible, robus t and in 
line with the GBP .

3.3 Management of Proce eds  
Proceeds from the Green SSD will be managed  and allocated  by Repower’s Treasury team.  While project  
evaluation and selection is carried out  on a project basis  (i.e. individual projects  are evaluated and 
selected based on eligibility criteria) , the  management of proceeds will be done by Repower  on a portfolio 
basis  (i.e. proceeds will be  allocated to the entire eligible  renewable energy project portfolio developed  
or acquired  since 2007  rather than  to specific projects) . 
  
Before  issuance , Repower  will verify  that the actual book value  of the assets4 included in  the project 
portfolio ( see Appendix  2) equals or exceed s the net proceeds of the total amount of Green SSDs 
outstanding  at time of issuance . This information will  be verified by Repower’s externa l auditor.  ","Sustainalytics considers that the use of proceeds is in alignment with the company’s strategy and will

Conclusion  
RWE  has developed the RWE Green Bond Framework under which it will issue green bonds and the use of 
proceeds to finance renewable energy production units, specifically solar energy, onshore and offshore wind 
farms. Sustainalytics considers that the project s funded by the green bond proceeds will provid e positive 
environmental impact  by increasing low -carbon electricity production.  
The RWE Green Bond Framework outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, allocated, and 
managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the use of 
proceeds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that  the RWE Green Bond Framework is aligned with the 
overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of proceed s category  will contribute to 
the advancement of  the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7.  Additionally, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that 
RWE  has adequate  measures to identify, manage and mitigate environmental and social risks commonly 
associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proceeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  RWE  is well -positioned to issue green bonds and that  the

Green Bond Principles 2018. Sustainalytics considers that the eligible category will lead to positive 
environmental impacts by increasing the capacity f or renewable energy production and advance the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 7 – Affordable & Clean Energy.  ","4 Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the RWE Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns with the four core components  of 
the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights th e following elements of RWE ’s Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible category , Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP 2018.  
- RWE may use proceeds for the conception, development, construction, installation and 
acquisition of renewable energy production units, specifically solar energy, onshore and offshore 
wind farms.  In regards to solar energy, RWE has indicated to Sustainalytics that  concentrated 
solar power (CSP)/solar thermal facilities are not currently in consideration to be financed, but 
may invest into these CSP/solar thermal facilities in the future. In the event that  financing is 
provided for such facilities, Sustainalytics re commends that the Issuer reports on  the use of 
fossil -fuel backup sources.  Projects will primarily be in Europe a nd North America. Sustainalytics 
positively views investments into the expansion of renewable energy capacity.  
- RWE has set a look -back period o f three years.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- RWE has established a Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”), which is comprised of 
representatives fro m RWE’s Corporate Responsibility, Finance & Credit Risk, Investor Relations 
and Controlling departments . The Committee is responsible for all aspects of project evaluation 
and selection, including reviewing and approving eligible projects for the Eligible Project 
Portfolio, monitoring project eligibility and removing/replacing as needed  
- Based o n this, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- RWE’s Finance & Credit Risk De partment will manage the allocation of proceeds. An amount 
equivalent to the net proceeds raised from the bond(s) will b e allocated to the Eligible Project 
Port folio  based on the recommendation of the Committee . Proceeds will be tracked via RWE’s 
internal tracking and accounting systems. RWE will strive to maintain a level of allocation for the 
Eligible Project Portfolio th at matches or exceeds the balance of  net proceeds from its 
outstanding green bonds. If any, unallocated proceeds will be temporarily held in RWE’s liquidity 
portfolio, invested in cash and/or cash equivalents,  and re-allocated as soon as feasible.  
- Based on  these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Reporting:  
- On an annual basis, RWE is committed to reporting on allocation and, where feasible, impact of 
the portfolio  at least at the Eligible Project cate gory level, starting one after issuance . Material 
developments such as, Framework modifications or allocation portfolio will be reported in a 
timely manner . Allocation reporting will include the total amount of investments and expe nditures 
allocated to the Eligible Project Portfolio , the portion of financing vs refinancing , and, if any, 
unallocated proceeds. In addition, RWE will strive to report  on estimate d positive environmental 
impact from projects using indicators such as annua l energy generation (in kWh) of green funded 
investments ; and estimated annual CO 2 avoided (tCO 2). In addition, RWE may provide 
qualitative descriptions of the outcomes and impacts of selected Eligible Projects.  
- Based o n the above, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 
Sustainalytics has determined that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components  of 
the GBP  201 8. For detailed information  please refer to Appendix 1: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme 
External Review Form.  ","2 Introduction  
In 2020, RWE  (“RWE ”, or the “Company”)  will become one of Europe’s largest providers  for renewable energy 
and the world’s second largest offshore wind company , after acquiring the renewable energy business es from 
E.ON and Innogy.  The Company has an international presence in 36 countries and in 2019  had approximately 
43GW of generation  capacity . 
RWE  has developed the RWE Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under which it intends to issue 
multiple  green bon ds and use the proceeds to finance  and/ or refinance, in whole or in part, existing  and/ or 
future projects tha t will contribute to  the expansion of renewable energy capacity, specifically solar energy as 
well as on - and off -shore wind farms.   The Framework defines eligibility criteria in one  area:  
1. Renewable Energy  
RWE  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  RWE Green Bond Framework , dated April  2020 , and provide a 
second -party opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its alignment  with the Green Bond 
Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate document .2  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics’ assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s alignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018  
• The credibility and antici pated positive impacts of the use of proceeds  
• The alignment of the issuer’s  sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management 
in relation to the use of proceeds  
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its inter nal taxonomy, versio n 1.3.1 , which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of RWE ’s management 
team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds, as well 
as management of proceeds and reporting asp ects of the Framework. RWE  representatives have confirmed 
(1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of RWE  to ensure that the information provided is complete, 
accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with all relevant inf ormation and (3) that any 
provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed 
relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and shoul d be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and RWE . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the align ment of the Framework with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects  expected to be financed with bond proceeds but does not measure actual impact. The measurement 
and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the responsibility of 
the Framework owner.  
In addition, the Second -Party Opinion opines on the intended allocation of proceeds but does not guarantee 
the realized  allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as 
being a statement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against the truthfulness, reliability ","Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns with the 
four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based on 
the following:  
  The eligible categor y for the use of proceeds , 
Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the Green 
Bond Pri nciples  2018 . Sustainalytics considers that the eligible 
category  will lead to positive environmental impacts  by increasing the  
capacity for renewable energy production  and advance the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals , specifically SD G 7  – Affordab le & 
Clean Energy . 
  RWE ’s internal process in 
evaluating and selecting p rojects i s overseen by a Green Bond 
Committee (the “Committee” ). The Committee will be responsible for 
the evaluation and selection of projects  that are  aligned with the  
Framework  eligibility criteria , the monitoring of the Project Portfolio 
and, if assets are no longer eligible, the Committee will replace them 
with eligible assets as soon as feasible.  Sustainalytics considers the 
project selection process in line with market practice . 
  RWE ’s processes for management 
of proceeds  is handled by the Finance & Credit Risk Department . 
Proceeds will be allocated to eligible projects  and tracked via RWE’s 
internal tracking a nd accounting systems. RWE will strive to maintain 
a level of allocatio n which matches or exceeds the balance of net 
proceeds from its outstanding green bonds. Any unallocated 
proceeds will be temporarily held in RWE’s liquidity portfolio invested 
in cash  and cash equivalents. This is in line with market practice . 
  RWE  intends to report allocation proceeds on its 
website , on an annual basis , until full allocatio n. The Company wil l 
report on total amount s of investments and expenditures allocated to 
eligible projects, financing vs refinancing and, if any, unallocated 
proceeds . In addition, RWE  is committed to reporting on relevant 
impact metrics . Sustainalytics views RWE ’s allocation and impact 
reporting as aligned with market practice.  ","10 Use of proceeds reporting:

ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures , such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green Bond Principles. In particular, it can include an as sessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally sustainable 
features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. Assurance or 
attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of funds fro m Green 
Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, may also be 
termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a re cognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may verify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  
iv. Green Bond Scoring/Rating: An issuer can have its Green Bond, associated Green Bond framework or a key 
feature such as Use of Proceeds evaluated or assessed by qualified third parties, such as specialised research 
providers or rating agencies, according to an establi shed scoring/rating methodology. The output may include 
a focus on environmental performance data, the process relative to the GBP, or another benchmark, such as 
a 2-degree climate change scenario. Such scoring/rating is distinct from credit ratings, which  may nonetheless 
reflect material environmental risks.

RWE  
Contribution of framework to RWE ’s sustainabilit y strategy  
RWE demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability and represents a high level of transparency in its 
sustainability reporting .4 The Company has d efined its sustainability  purp ose as “Our energy for a sustainable 
life”  and its transition towards clean, renewable energy is embedded in to t he business. I n 2019, RWE  was 
able to reduce energy emissions compared to the previous year , making it the seventh consecutive year of 
reduced emissions. Since 2012, the Company has  succ eeded in halving its CO 2 emissions, representing a 
saving of more than 90 million metric tons  of CO 2. As part of its commitment to sustainability , RWE has 
established the objective of  becoming carbon  neutral by 2040.4 As one of the  leading energy supplier s in 
Europe, this is a n ambitious  goal that , if achieved, could contribute significantly to national climate reduction 
targets. As such, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the renewable energy projects and activities financed 
under this Framework will contribute to RWE’s sustainability strategy and its 2040 target to become carbon  
neutral.  
Well positioned to address common environmental and  social risks associated with  the projects    
While  it is recognized that  the net proceeds from the bonds issued under the Framework will be directed 
towards eligible projects that are recognized by the  GBP 2018 , Sustainalytics  acknowledges that the 
development of renewable energy  facilities and related infrastructure has associated environmental  and social 
risks . Some key environmental and social risks associated could include land -use  change , water use and 
wast e management  as well as worker health and safety issues and community safety . Sustainalytics  is of the 
opinion that  RWE  can  manage and/or mitigate potential risks through its implementation of the following:    
• RWE has established an Environmental Managemen t System (EMS)  that follows the ISO 14001 
standard, which is viewed as a robust, credible international EMS standard .5 As of 2019, the 89% of 
the Company’s EMS’ were externally certified and the Company maintains a goal to obtain 100% 
coverage  of its’ EMS  systems.6 
• The Company’s waste prevention and disposal policy follows the waste  hierarchy and aims to 
prevent, reuse, recycle and eliminate waste  to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, the Company 
strives to reduce its water use and ensure proper treatment of any effluents.7 
• RWE requires all employees to go through intensive training for accident -preventio n and  to create 
awareness about general safe working conditions. The Company has als o implemented processes 
to ensure community safety and regularly engages with local stakeholders  to ensure readiness  in the 
event of any safety risk .8 
Based on these policies, standards , and assessments, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that RWE  has 
implemented adequate  measures and is well positioned to ma nage and mitigate environmental and social  
risks commonly associated with the eligible categories.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
Renewable energy is a  use of proceeds catego ry recognized  by the GBP.  Sustainalytics has provided 
commentary below to highlight the impact s of this category  relevant to the local context.  
Increasing Renewable Energy Power  Capacity  & Generation  in the EU  
Energy production and consumption are the largest source s of GHG emissions in the EU.9 To reduce  energy -
related emissions  and the reliance on fossil fuels , the EU has set a binding target to achieve  a share of at 
least 32% of renewable energy by 2030 .10 This would also help the EU in meeting  its emission reduction 
targets ; the EU and its Member States are committed to a minimum 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions  
by 2030, from 1990 levels .10 Forecast studies have show n that to achiev e a  35% share of renewable  energy 
sources  in final consumption , total  renewable electricity production should range between 60 -65% , 
demonstrating the need for substantial expansion  of renewable energy  production .11 In 2018, renewables ","

  ","4 Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the RWE Green Bond Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns with the four core components  of 
the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights th e following elements of RWE ’s Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible category , Renewable Energy , is aligned with those recognized by the GBP 2018.  
- RWE may use proceeds for the conception, development, construction, installation and 
acquisition of renewable energy production units, specifically solar energy, onshore and offshore 
wind farms.  In regards to solar energy, RWE has indicated to Sustainalytics that  concentrated 
solar power (CSP)/solar thermal facilities are not currently in consideration to be financed, but 
may invest into these CSP/solar thermal facilities in the future. In the event that  financing is 
provided for such facilities, Sustainalytics re commends that the Issuer reports on  the use of 
fossil -fuel backup sources.  Projects will primarily be in Europe a nd North America. Sustainalytics 
positively views investments into the expansion of renewable energy capacity.  
- RWE has set a look -back period o f three years.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:  
- RWE has established a Green Bond Committee (the “Committee”), which is comprised of 
representatives fro m RWE’s Corporate Responsibility, Finance & Credit Risk, Investor Relations 
and Controlling departments . The Committee is responsible for all aspects of project evaluation 
and selection, including reviewing and approving eligible projects for the Eligible Project 
Portfolio, monitoring project eligibility and removing/replacing as needed  
- Based o n this, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- RWE’s Finance & Credit Risk De partment will manage the allocation of proceeds. An amount 
equivalent to the net proceeds raised from the bond(s) will b e allocated to the Eligible Project 
Port folio  based on the recommendation of the Committee . Proceeds will be tracked via RWE’s 
internal tracking and accounting systems. RWE will strive to maintain a level of allocation for the 
Eligible Project Portfolio th at matches or exceeds the balance of  net proceeds from its 
outstanding green bonds. If any, unallocated proceeds will be temporarily held in RWE’s liquidity 
portfolio, invested in cash and/or cash equivalents,  and re-allocated as soon as feasible.  
- Based on  these elements, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
• Reporting:  
- On an annual basis, RWE is committed to reporting on allocation and, where feasible, impact of 
the portfolio  at least at the Eligible Project cate gory level, starting one after issuance . Material 
developments such as, Framework modifications or allocation portfolio will be reported in a 
timely manner . Allocation reporting will include the total amount of investments and expe nditures 
allocated to the Eligible Project Portfolio , the portion of financing vs refinancing , and, if any, 
unallocated proceeds. In addition, RWE will strive to report  on estimate d positive environmental 
impact from projects using indicators such as annua l energy generation (in kWh) of green funded 
investments ; and estimated annual CO 2 avoided (tCO 2). In addition, RWE may provide 
qualitative descriptions of the outcomes and impacts of selected Eligible Projects.  
- Based o n the above, Sustainalytics considers this process  to be in line with market practice.  
Alignment with Green Bond Principles 201 8 
Sustainalytics has determined that the RWE Green Bond Framework aligns to the four core components  of 
the GBP  201 8. For detailed information  please refer to Appendix 1: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme

the realised allocation of the bond proceeds towards eligible activities.  
No information provided by Sustainalytics under the present Second -Party Opinion shall be considered as 
being a s tatement, representation, warrant or argument either in favour or against, the truthfulness, reliability 
or completeness of any facts or statements and related surrounding circumstances that Synthesis   has made

Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’  Opinion on the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond 
Framework  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  aligns with the four core 
components  of the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Synthesis ’ Green Bond 
Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The eligible categor ies  Renewable Energy , Green Digital Solutions , Energy Efficiency  and Green 
Buildings are  aligned with those recognized by the GBP . Projects financed will aim  to provid e 
energy efficient HPC cent re solutions , with a  focus on the Swedish market. Sustainalytics is of 
the opinion that energy efficient HPC centers can reduce overall energy consumption and 
provide opportunities for capturing waste  heat.  
- Renewable Energy financing  may include the development, construction , maintenance and 
operation of wind or solar energy as well as the procurement of renewable energy through  long -
term Power  Purchase  Agreements (“PPAs”) . Sustainalytics positively views these expenditures  
and notes that, for the first issuance, this categor y makes up the bulk of expenditures . 
- Green Digital Solutions may include research and development (“R&D”) expenditures  for the 
depl oyment of systems, products and technology that increase energy efficiency including 
development of energy efficient micro -architecture components, optimize d algorithms and 
hardware, data analytics and cloud products and solutions.  Sustainalytics recognizes that R&D 
activities have the potential to result in positive environmental outcomes, while also noting that 
it is very  difficult to quantify the impacts of R&D related activities until commercialization .  
Sustainaly tics encourages Synthesis to report on estimated or achieved energy efficiency 
savings , on a portfolio basis, where feasible.  
- Energy Efficiency expenditures may include the development of energy efficient electronic 
equi pment, improved cooling solutions, energy capture4 and reuse , energy storage systems and 
the consolidation/optimization of HPC centers  for the purpose of increasing energy efficiency.  
For example, this  includes the production  and deployment of energy efficient Integrated 
Computing Units  (ICUs) which can reduce the energy used for each unit of work by 20 -30% 
compared to a traditional data center . Additionally, expenditures may  be allocated to the 
installation  of immersion cooling system s tha t serve  to both improve cooling and captu re waste -
heat. Similarly, the deployment of  systems to capture waste -heat f rom HPCs for use in district 
heating ( “DH”) may  be financed. Sustainalytics positively views reuse of waste -heat and 
improvements in energy efficiency and encourages the Issuer to r eport on estimated or achieved 
energy efficiency savings /total amount of waste -heat generated , on a portfolio basis, where 
feasible.  
- Green Building expenditures may include the development, acquisition, leasing or renovation of 
commercial buildings that have obtained one of the following certifications: BREEAM “Excellent” 
or above; LEED “Gold” or above; BCA Green mark “Gold” or above; CEEDA “Gold” or above or 
other equivalent standards. Susta inalytics positively views the establishment of minimum 
certification levels and recognizes these levels as commensurate with best practice. For 
Sustainalytics assessment of these schemes, please refer to Appendix 1.  
- Sustainalytics notes that the Issuer ha s set a 24-month  lookback period.  ","6 Renewable Energy  7. Affordable & Clean Energy  7.2  By 2030, increase substantially the share of

Conclusion   
Synthesis  Analytics  has developed the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  under which it will issue 
green bonds and the use of proceeds to finance  HPC centres and provide green computing products and 
solutions that improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and capture waste -heat. Sustainalytics considers that 
the projec ts funded by the green bond proceeds will provide positive environmental impact .  
The Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  outlines a process by which proceeds will be tracked, 
allocated, and managed, and commitments have been made for reporting on the allocation and impact of the 
use of proce eds. Furthermore, Sustainalytics believes that  the  Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  is 
aligned with the overall sustainability strategy of the company and that the green use of procee ds categor ies  
will contribute to the advancement of  the  UN Sustai nable Development Goa ls 7 & 11 . Additionally, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Synthesis   has sufficient measures to identify, manage and mitigate 
environmental and social risks commonly associated with the eligible projects funded by the use of proc eeds.  
Based on the above, Sustainalytics is confident that  Synthesis Analytics  is well -positioned to issue green 
bonds and that  the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  is robust, transparent, and in alignment with 
the four core components of the Green Bond Principles 2018.  
  ","2 Introduction  
Synthesis Analytics  (the “Company”)  is a technology company based in Sweden offering High Performance 
Computing (HPC) products and services to companies with a focus on minimizing resource use, maximizing 
energy efficiency and capturing/reusing waste -heat energy.  
Synthesis Analytics  has developed the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under 
which i t intends to iss ue multiple  green bon ds through the special -purpose vehicle, Sustainable Capital Plc , 
and use the proceeds t o finance and/or refinance , in whole or  in part , existing  and/ or future projects that aim 
to improve the efficiency of HPC  centres . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in the following  areas:  
1. Renewable Energy  
2. Green Digital Solutions  
3. Energy Efficiency  
4. Green Buildings  
Synthesis  Analytics  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework , dated  
May  2020 , and provide a second -party opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its 
alignment  with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate 
document .2  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics  assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s al ignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018  
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds  
• The alignment of the issuer’s  sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management 
in relation to the use of proc eeds  
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version  1.3.1 , which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversa tions with various members of Synthesi s’ 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Synthesis   
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Synthesis   to ensure that 
the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with 
all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Synthesis Analytics . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framewo rk with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be fin anced with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  ","Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:

ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion: An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s adviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as information barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issuer’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluatio n of the environmental features of the type of projects intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independent verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental cri teria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
internal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the environmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s internal tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceeds, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certificat ion: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external green standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, ","5 • The Swedish Work Environment Authority (SWEA)  issue s provisions designating  employer 
responsibility to preve nt ill health and accidents, and to create a good working environment .7 The 
SWEA ’s Statute Book  detail s regulations about , inter alia,  the transport of material at construction 
sites, roof work, and safety nets , first aid and crisis support , ergonomics for the prevention of 
musculoskeletal disorders , that aim to reduce the occupational  hazard .8 
• Sweden is classified as a “Designated C ountry” under the Equator Principles, i ndicating  the presence 
of robust environment and social governance systems , legislation, and institutional capacity for 
protecting the environment and communities.9 
Based on the  above , Sustainalytics is of the opinio n that the potential risks associated with Synthesis  
Analytics ’ activities in Sweden can be mitigated. However, Sustainalytics notes that Synthesis Analytics does 
not have any publicly available risk management policies , which is viewed as a shortcoming.  
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
All five  use of proceeds categories are aligned with those recognized  by the GBP.  Sustainalyt ics discusses 
below where the impact is specifically relevant in  the  local  context  
Increasing energy efficiency through HPC centres  
From  2015 to 2020, the IT sector ’s energy consumption increased by approximately  9% per year , while GHG 
emissions increased by approximately 8% per year.10 In 2020, the IT sector is expected to be responsible for 
about 4% of global GHG emissions  and for approximately 3.3. % of the world’s energy consumption .10 Data 
centers alone are estimated to be responsible for 19% of the sector ’s energy consumption, highlighting their 
contribution to the sector’s environmental footprint.10 Moreove r, the total energy consumption of  data centers 
doubles every four years, which means that their carbon footprint is the fastest growing in the IT sector.11 This 
is primarily due to (i) the growth in data traffic, (ii) the growth in volume of data to be stored and (iii) the growth 
in the volume of operations.10 In Sweden, the government  has establishe d a long term goal of net -zero GHG 
by 2045 , and HPC centers offer an opportunity for increasing energy efficiency and reducing overall GHG 
emissions.  
HPC centers , which  are more energy efficient than traditional data centers , can help to offset the energy 
consumption and enable energy savings . Data centers use 40-60% additional energy above the energy 
expended to run the equipment doing the actual useful work , while HPC centers use less than  2% additional 
energy for cooling and operations.12 Thus, the PUE of centers is estimated at 1.02, which is considered “very 
efficient.”13 Energy efficiency in HPC is influenced by four  main elements , (i) building infrastructure, (ii) system 
hardware, (iii) system software and (iv) applications.14  The HPC  activities financed from this Framework  
categories could help the Synthesis Analytics  improv e energy efficiency in the four main elements. For 
instance, optimized algorithms, data analytics and cloud products and solutions could improve the efficiency 
of system software.  
Sustainalyti cs is of the opinion that financed projects  can  contribut e to reduc ing  the environmental impacts 
of HPC systems by improving their energy efficiency  and help Sweden meet its 2045 net -zero GHG target.

Synthesis Analytics  (the “Company”)  is a technology company based in Sweden offering High Performance 
Computing (HPC) products and services to companies with a focus on minimizing resource use, maximizing 
energy efficiency and capturing/reusing waste -heat energy.  
Synthesis Analytics  has developed the Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework  (the “ Framework ”) under 
which i t intends to iss ue multiple  green bon ds through the special -purpose vehicle, Sustainable Capital Plc , 
and use the proceeds t o finance and/or refinance , in whole or  in part , existing  and/ or future projects that aim 
to improve the efficiency of HPC  centres . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in the following  areas:  
1. Renewable Energy  
2. Green Digital Solutions  
3. Energy Efficiency  
4. Green Buildings  
Synthesis  Analytics  engaged Sustainalytics to review the  Synthesis Analytics Green Bond Framework , dated  
May  2020 , and provide a second -party opinion on the Framework ’s environmental credentials and its 
alignment  with the Green Bond Principles 201 8 (GBP) .1 This Framework has been published in a separate 
document .2  
Scope of work and limitations of Sustainalytics Second -Party Opinion  
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion reflects Sustainalytics independent3 opinion on the alignment of the 
reviewed Framework with the current market standards and the extent to which the eligible categories are 
credible and impactful.  
As part of the Second -Party Opinion, Sustainalytics  assessed the following:  
• The Framework’s al ignment with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2018  
• The credibility and anticipated positive impacts of the use of proceeds  
• The alignment of the issuer’s  sustainability strategy and performance and sustainability risk management 
in relation to the use of proc eeds  
For the use of proceeds assessment, Sustainalytics relied on its internal taxonomy, version  1.3.1 , which is 
informed by market practice and Sustainalytics ’ expertise as an ESG research provider.  
As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversa tions with various members of Synthesi s’ 
management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of 
proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of the Framework. Synthesis   
representatives have confirmed (1) they understand it is the sole responsibility of Synthesis   to ensure that 
the information provided is complete, accurate or up to date; (2) that they have provided Sustainalytics with 
all relevant information and (3) that any provided material information has been duly disclosed in a timely 
manner. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  
This document contains Sustainalytics’ opinion of the Framework and should be read in conjunction with that 
Framework.  
Any update of the present Second -Party Opinion will be conducted according to the agreed engagement 
conditions between Sustainalytics and Synthesis Analytics . 
Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion, while reflecting on the alignment of the Framewo rk with market 
standards, is no guarantee of alignment nor warrants any alignment with future versions of relevant market 
standards. Furthermore, Sustainalytics’ Second -Party Opinion addresses the anticipated impacts of eligible 
projects expected to be fin anced with bond proceeds but does not measure the actual impact. The 
measurement and reporting of the impact achieved through projects financed under the Framework is the 
responsibility of the Framework owner.  ","9

1. USE OF PROCEEDS  
Overall comment on section (if applicable) :  
The use of proceeds category of the Water Wh eel Gree n Securities Green Bond Framework , i.e. Renewable 
Energy, is recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018 as project category having positive environmental 
benefits. Water Wheel Green Securities’ investments in solar energy projects will contribut e to ren ewable 
energy development through facilitating rooftop solar PV investments and thus to decarbonizing the energy 
sector.  
Water Wheel Green Securities intends to allocate the proceeds to expenditures related to the development, 
construction, install ation an d maintenance of rooftop solar PV systems. Sustainalytics recognizes that CAPEX 
such as development, construction and installation is generally preferred by investors for funding the projects, 
however, it also believes that, given the nature to the  eligibl e projects, OPEX will be important to maintain solar 
energy systems and to sustain positive environmental impacts.  
Water Wheel Green Securities’ look -back period for refinancing previous investments is 3 years prior to the 
issuance date of the bond s.  
Wate r Wheel Green Securities clarified that all investments will be exclusively for solar energy in 2020.   ","Water Wheels Green Securities has developed the Water Wheel Green Securities Green Bond F ramework  (the 
“Framework ”) under which it intends to issue green bond s and use the proceeds to finance  and  refinance , in 
whole or  in part, existing  and  future  renewable energy projects that  help reduce total greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by increasing ren ewable energy production through the rooftop solar installation s and thus 
increasing accessibility to affordable and clean energy.  The Framework defines eli gibility criteria in the 
following  area:  ","Evaluation Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Water Wheel  Green Securities  Green Bond 
Framework  is credible and impactful and aligns with the four core components of the 
Green Bond Principles 2018. This assessment is based on the following:   
  The eligible category for th e use of proceeds  – 
Renewable Energy – is aligned with those recognized by the Green 
Bond Pri nciples.  Sustainalytics considers tha t financing of rooftop  
solar energy  systems  will facilitate utilising the full potential of solar 
energy  in the Netherlands,  and thus increase access to affordable and 
clean energy . Financing  will  also advance UN  Sustainable 
Development Goal  7. 
  Green Securit ies  Advisory , the 
financial advisor y company within Water Wheel Green Securities , will 
be responsible for the project evaluation and selection. Selected 
projects will be developed by the Solar Development Corporation , the 
project execution  entity of Water Wheel G reen Securities . On at least 
a quarterly basis, t he Management Team of Water Wheel Green 
Securities will review  and approve allocation of  bond  proceeds  based 
on eligibility criteria . The process for evaluation and selection is 
aligned with market practice.  
  Solar Development Corporation  will 
establish separate entities , a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV),  for each 
roof  where the project will be located.  Solar Power Corporation , the 
mother com pan y of the listed SPVs,  will be responsible f or the green 
bond issuance . T he net proceeds of  the  green bonds will be 
deposited into an individual account . Pending full allocation,  the 
unallocated proceeds will be invested  in cash, cash equiva lents 
and/or other liquid marketable instruments by  Green Securities 
Advisory . At least quarterly,  selected eligible assets will be reviewed 
by the Management Team of Water Wheel Green Securities . In case 
of any material change based on  the  eligibility cr iteria, Green 
Securities Advisory, where feasible,  will replace the assets with 
eligible projects as soon as new roof top  solar options ha ve been 
identified. This process is in line with market practices.   
  Until full allocation, Green Securitie s Advisory  intends to 
publish an annual allocation and impact report on the Water Wheel 
Green Securities’ website. Allocation reporting will include the 
amount of allocated proceeds , remaining balance of unallocated 
proceeds  and where feasible,  material ch anges and/or substitution of 
eligible projects.  Impact reporting will include the impact indicators  
associated with the projects. Green Security Advisory  intends to 
appoint an external auditor to request a n annual  limited assurance 
report of the allocation  of the bond proceeds. Sustainalytics views 
this process as in line with best market practice.

While Sustainalytics recognizes the positive impact of the use of proceeds, it acknowledge s that roof top  solar 
PV projects have potential environmental and social risks main ly related to occupational health and safety, 
resulting from exposure to hazardous chemicals , improper management of electric al safety  and  work ing at 
height . 
WWSG executes its rooftop solar PV projects through the umbrella agreements with  companies prov iding  
Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) and Operations, Maintenance (O&M) services , which are 
certified to the ISO 90013 and 450014 sta ndards.  Following  the design of rooftop solar  panels conducted by 
EPC  companies , technical audits are performed by independent technical advisor s, aiming to make sure  that  
the design of  rooftop solar PV projects are execute d within the bounds of environmen tal and social standards . 
After the assignment of projects to O&M companies, a technical advisor performs an additional audit  to the 
installation and provides a Final Acceptance  Certificate.  WWSG confirmed to Sustainalytics that the potential 
risks  are ana lyzed and mitigated  during the desig n, construction, and pre -production stage  by respective 
audits . 
Given  WWSG ’s collaboration with external parties for environmental and social risk identification, and 
technical audits  being implemented in the  project lif e cycle , Sustainalytics is of the opinion that WWSG is well 
positioned to  mitigate environmental and social risks related to the eligible projects . 
Section 3: Impact of Use of Proceeds  
The  use of proceeds categor y is  recognized as impactful by GBP. Sustai nalytics has focused on the  below 
where the impact is specifically relevant in the local context.  ","3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the  Water Wheel  Green Securities Green 
Bond Framework  
Summary   
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Water Wheel  Green Securities Green Bond Framework  is credible and 
impactful, and aligns with the four core components  of the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the following 
elements of Water Wheel Green Securities ’ Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Procee ds:  
- The use of proceeds category of the Water Wheel Green Securities Green Bond Framework , i.e. 
Renewable Energy, is recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018 as project category having 
positive environ mental benefits. Water Wheel Green Securities ’ investm ents in solar energy 
projects will contribute to renewable energy development through  facilitating rooftop solar  PV  
investments and thus to decarbonizing the energy sector . 
- Water Wheel Green Securities intends to allocate the proceeds to expenditures related to the 
development, construction , installation and maintenance of rooftop solar PV systems . 
Sustainalytics recognizes that CAPEX such as development, construction and installation is 
generally prefer red by investors for funding the projects, howeve r, it also believes that, given the 
nature to the eligible projects, OPEX will be important to maintain solar energy systems  and to 
sustain positive environmental impacts . 
- Water Wheel Green Securities’ look -back period for refinancing previous investments is 3 years 
prior to the issuance date of the bonds. Sustainalytics views this practice as aligned with current 
market expectations.   
- Wa ter Wheel Green Securities clarified that all investmen ts will be exclusively for solar energy in 
2020 . In the case o f any material change, Sustainalytics encourages Water Wheels to provide 
disclosure  and report  on the intended renewable energy investments for  future projects.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:   
- As the financial advisory company within  Water Wheel Green Secur ities , Green Securities 
Advisory will oversee  the project evaluation and selection.  Solar Development Corporation will 
develop the s elected projects as the project execution entity of Water Wheel Green Securities . 
On at least a quarterly basis, the Managem ent Team of Water Wheel Green Securities will review  
and approve the  allocation  of green bond proceeds in conformity with  the  eligibility criteria.   
- This project evaluation and selecti on process  is in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) , a separate entity, will be established by Solar Development 
Corporation for each roof where the project will be located.  As the mother company of the listed 
SPVs , Solar Power Corporation  will be responsible for the  green bond  issuance.  The net 
proceeds of green bonds will be deposited into an individual account.   
- Pending full allocation, Green Securities Advisory  will hold and/or invest within a separat e 
account in cash, cash equivalents and/or other liquid marketable instrumen ts to eligible 
renewable energy.  
- At least once a quarter , selected eligible assets will be reviewed by the Management Team of 
Water Wheel Green Securities . If any material change  is made based on eligibility criteria,  Green 
Securities Advisory will replac e the assets  with o ther  roof top  solar options  as soon as it is  
feasible .  
- Sustainalytics views this process as aligned with market practice.   
• Reporting:  
- Until full allocation, Green Securities Advisory  intends to publish an annual allocation and impact 
rep ort  on the Company’s website . In the a llocation report , Green Securities Advisory will  disclose  
information including  the amount of allocated proceeds , remaining balance of unallocated 
proceeds,  and where feasible, material changes and/or substitution of e ligible projects.  Impact 
reporting will include the amount of generated renewable energy and the indicative volume of  
carbon emissions avoided a ssociated with the projects.  "," 
ABOUT ROLE(S) OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROVIDERS AS DEFINED BY THE GBP  
i. Second Party Opinion : An institution with environmental expertise, that is independent from the issuer may 
issue a Second Party Opinion. The institution should be independent from the issuer’s a dviser for its Green 
Bond framework, or appropriate procedures, such as informatio n barriers, will have been implemented within 
the institution to ensure the independence of the Second Party Opinion. It normally entails an assessment of 
the alignment with the Green  Bond Principles. In particular,  it can include an assessment of the issu er’s 
overarching objectives, strategy, policy and/or processes relating to environmental sustainability, and an 
evaluation of the environmental features of the type of projec ts intended for the Use of Proceeds.  
ii. Verification: An issuer can obtain independe nt verification against a designated set of criteria, typically 
pertaining to business processes and/or environmental criteria. Verification may focus on alignment with 
inter nal or external standards or claims made by the issuer. Also, evaluation of the en vironmentally 
sustainable features of underlying assets may be termed verification and may reference external criteria. 
Assurance or attestation regarding an issuer’s interna l tracking method for use of proceeds, allocation of 
funds from Green Bond proceed s, statement of environmental impact or alignment of reporting with the GBP, 
may also be termed verification.  
iii. Certification: An issuer can have its Green Bond or associated Green Bond framework or Use of Proceeds 
certified against a recognised external gr een standard or label. A standard or label defines specific criteria, 
and alignment with such criteria is normally tested by qualified, accredited third parties, which may ve rify 
consistency with the certification criteria.  ","As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conve rsations with various members of Water Wheel Green 
Securities’  management team to understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and 
planned u se of proceeds, as well as management of proceeds and reporting aspects of SPC ’s Green Bond  
Framework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public documents and non -public information.  "," 
Conclusion  
Water Wheel Green Securities has developed its Green Bond Framework to finance existing and future rooftop 
sol ar PV system projects. The eligible category – Renewable Energy – is recognized as impactful by the Green 
Bond Principles 2018 and Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the fi nanced projects will contribute to utilising 
the full potential of solar energy i n the Netherlands, and thus increase access to affordable and clean energy.  
Sustainalytics considers Water Wheel Green Securities ’ project evaluation and selection process, 
ma nagement of proceeds and reporting to be aligned with market practice. Based on t he above 
considerations, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Water Wheel Green Securities  is well positioned to issue 
green bonds  and that the Water Wheel Green Securities Green Bond Framework is robust, credible, transparent 
and in alignment with the Gr een Bond Principles  2018 .

 ","Well positioned  to address common environmental and social risks associated with  the projects  
While Sustainalytics recognizes the positive impact of the use of proceeds, it acknowledge s that roof top  solar 
PV projects have potential environmental and social risks main ly related to occupational health and safety, 
resulting from exposure to hazardous chemicals , improper management of electric al safety  and  work ing at 
height . 
WWSG executes its rooftop solar PV projects through the umbrella agreements with  companies prov iding  
Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) and Operations, Maintenance (O&M) services , which are 
certified to the ISO 90013 and 450014 sta ndards.  Following  the design of rooftop solar  panels conducted by 
EPC  companies , technical audits are performed by independent technical advisor s, aiming to make sure  that  
the design of  rooftop solar PV projects are execute d within the bounds of environmen tal and social standards . 
After the assignment of projects to O&M companies, a technical advisor performs an additional audit  to the 
installation and provides a Final Acceptance  Certificate.  WWSG confirmed to Sustainalytics that the potential 
risks  are ana lyzed and mitigated  during the desig n, construction, and pre -production stage  by respective 
audits . 
Given  WWSG ’s collaboration with external parties for environmental and social risk identification, and

  ","3 Sustainalytics’ Opinion  
Section 1: Sustainalytics’ Opinion on the  Water Wheel  Green Securities Green 
Bond Framework  
Summary   
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Water Wheel  Green Securities Green Bond Framework  is credible and 
impactful, and aligns with the four core components  of the GBP  201 8. Sustainalytics highlights the following 
elements of Water Wheel Green Securities ’ Green Bond Framework : 
• Use of Procee ds:  
- The use of proceeds category of the Water Wheel Green Securities Green Bond Framework , i.e. 
Renewable Energy, is recognized by the Green Bond Principles 2018 as project category having 
positive environ mental benefits. Water Wheel Green Securities ’ investm ents in solar energy 
projects will contribute to renewable energy development through  facilitating rooftop solar  PV  
investments and thus to decarbonizing the energy sector . 
- Water Wheel Green Securities intends to allocate the proceeds to expenditures related to the 
development, construction , installation and maintenance of rooftop solar PV systems . 
Sustainalytics recognizes that CAPEX such as development, construction and installation is 
generally prefer red by investors for funding the projects, howeve r, it also believes that, given the 
nature to the eligible projects, OPEX will be important to maintain solar energy systems  and to 
sustain positive environmental impacts . 
- Water Wheel Green Securities’ look -back period for refinancing previous investments is 3 years 
prior to the issuance date of the bonds. Sustainalytics views this practice as aligned with current 
market expectations.   
- Wa ter Wheel Green Securities clarified that all investmen ts will be exclusively for solar energy in 
2020 . In the case o f any material change, Sustainalytics encourages Water Wheels to provide 
disclosure  and report  on the intended renewable energy investments for  future projects.  
• Project Evaluation and Selection:   
- As the financial advisory company within  Water Wheel Green Secur ities , Green Securities 
Advisory will oversee  the project evaluation and selection.  Solar Development Corporation will 
develop the s elected projects as the project execution entity of Water Wheel Green Securities . 
On at least a quarterly basis, the Managem ent Team of Water Wheel Green Securities will review  
and approve the  allocation  of green bond proceeds in conformity with  the  eligibility criteria.   
- This project evaluation and selecti on process  is in line with market practice.  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) , a separate entity, will be established by Solar Development 
Corporation for each roof where the project will be located.  As the mother company of the listed 
SPVs , Solar Power Corporation  will be responsible for the  green bond  issuance.  The net 
proceeds of green bonds will be deposited into an individual account.   
- Pending full allocation, Green Securities Advisory  will hold and/or invest within a separat e 
account in cash, cash equivalents and/or other liquid marketable instrumen ts to eligible 
renewable energy.  
- At least once a quarter , selected eligible assets will be reviewed by the Management Team of 
Water Wheel Green Securities . If any material change  is made based on eligibility criteria,  Green 
Securities Advisory will replac e the assets  with o ther  roof top  solar options  as soon as it is  
feasible .  
- Sustainalytics views this process as aligned with market practice.   
• Reporting:  
- Until full allocation, Green Securities Advisory  intends to publish an annual allocation and impact 
rep ort  on the Company’s website . In the a llocation report , Green Securities Advisory will  disclose  
information including  the amount of allocated proceeds , remaining balance of unallocated 
proceeds,  and where feasible, material changes and/or substitution of e ligible projects.  Impact 
reporting will include the amount of generated renewable energy and the indicative volume of  
carbon emissions avoided a ssociated with the projects.  ","[4, 10]"

ele ctrification of trains  is also significant in the context of Germany’s transportation priorities. The 
electrification  of passenger trains offers significant GHG reduction potential and is a step to ensure that 
Germany’s infrastructure is capable of handling predicted increased d emand in railway traffic.  Germany 
is the biggest regional rail market in Europe with roughly one quarter of the total number of passengers 
in Europe carried.  The country’s railway network is 86 percent electrified and already offers a high level 
of perfor mance.  Between 1994 and 2008, there was a rise in the proportion of passenger transport 
covered by rail passenger transport from 6.6 % to 7.5 %, showing an increased demand in the mode of 
transportation.  ","Reporting  
Allocation Reporting  
Alpha Trains will report on allocation of proceeds of the Green Private Placement in an annual Full Year 
Investor Report, which will be published up to 180 days after financial year -end . Given that all the Green 
Private Placement proceeds will be allocated  at the moment of issuance , information  on the full allocation

will report on the list of  Eligible Assets  refinanced on a project -by-project basis.   
  
Environmental impact reporting  
Alpha Trains is intending to annually report on the following impact metric: prospective carbon offset 
from Eligible EMU trains, in grams (g) of carbon dioxide equivalents. These metrics will be disclosed on a 
project -by-project basis. Alpha Trains will re ly on current train operators to supply information on 
average distance per passenger (in kilometers) in order to calculate carbon offset and other required 
assumptions will be used based on publicly available information or general market assumptions. Thi s 
information will be gathered and the carbon impact will be reported on a best effort basis.   ","Project Evaluation and Selection  Process

through the development of  clean transportation  and the accompanying  reduction in GHG 
emissions from  Italy’s public transport sector. Additional details on impact are provided in Section 
3. 
• Following the assessment of Ferrovie’s sustainability strategy and the use of proceeds, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion tha t the use of proceeds from the Green B ond will contribute to 
Ferrovie’s sustainability strategy and overall strategy to make trains, as a sustainable means of 
passenger transport, more attractive in Italy. For further details please see Section 2.  
• Ferrovie has a dedicated green bond working committee for project evaluation and selection, 
inc luding members of  Ferrovie’s f inance and  sustainability teams and will be chaired by the

practice.  
• Ferrovie will report on  its website,  on an annual basis, the allocation of the bond proceeds by 
eligible project category. In addition, an external auditor will ve rify the allocated proceeds to 
“Eligible Green P rojects ” and the remaining balance of unallocated proceeds on an annual basis . 
This information will  be reported  in Ferrovie’s annual report review. Th ese reporting practices are  
in line with market best practice.

such as GHG reduction, energy reduction and hazardous emission reduction. The reporting will 
be conducted  for each eligible proj ect category on an annual basis and will be made available on 
Ferrovie’s website. Since the trains eligible for the use of proceeds are provided with energy 
measur ement  systems ,2 Sustainalytics believes that  the company is well positioned to report on  
relevant metrics.  ","The net proceeds of each green bond will be used to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, new projects  
or existing  projects  (refinancing  may apply to  project s dat ed back  a maximum  of two  years ) to renew the  
firm’s  Public Transport Rolling Stock . The Framework defines eligibility criteria in two areas:  ","Ferrovie intends to use the proceeds for investments in renewal of its rolling stock including (i) the 
purchase of new Electric Multiple Unit trains for regional passenger transport  and (ii) the purchase of  “ETR 
1000”  high -speed trains.  The use of proceeds categories are recognized as impactful by the GBP.  In the 
following Sustainalytics  will explain the local context.   
Impact of electric rail transit on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction  
In addition, advancing rail transportation is closely linked to achieving climate targets  and to the EU -wide 
reduction targets for GHG emissions from transportation outlined in the “Roadmap to a Single European 
Transport Area .”11 The Commission aspires to meet these targets by priorit ising modes of transportation 
that can easily carry large numbers of passengers, such as rail, over cars. Advancing the  rail transit is also 
likely to contribute to the Italy ’s GHG emission target of 40% reduction by 2030 compared  to 1990 levels, 
given that t he transportation sector in Italy contributed 27.95% of Italy’s  GHG emissions in 2012 .12  ","Use of proceeds categories as per GBP:  
☐ Renewable energy  
 ☒ Energy efficiency  ","Having reviewed Ferrovie ’s Green Bond Framework and sustainability strategy, Sustainalytics beli eves 
that the use of proceeds is well aligned with the company’s aim to promote clean transportation  and that 
they will contribute  to the GHG  reduction targets set by Italy and in the EU Roadmap to a Single European 
Transport Area, as well as SDG 11  and 12. The eligible categories for the use of proceeds are  also  aligned 
with those recognized by the  Green Bond Principle s.  ","While the energy efficiency improvements  declared by the train manufacturers  still need to be proven 
once the trains are in operation, g iven the declared energy improvements of the new electric trains 
compared to previous models, as well as recyclability  of the trains, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the 
use of proceeds contributes  to increased sustainability and energy efficiency of Ferrovie  Group ’s 
operations and the mobility  system in Italy .  ","As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of Ferrovie  Group ’s 
sustainability , finance and procurement  team s to understand the sustainability impact of their business 
processes and planned use of proceeds , as well as the management of proceeds and the reporting aspect s 
of Ferrovie’s  Green Bond F ramework . Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public  documents  and  non -
public information . Following this engagement between Ferrovie and Sustainalytics, some elements of 
the Green Bond Framework were clarified to ensure alignment with the expect ations for  disclosure 
reflected in the  Gre en Bond Principles.  "," 
 15 
Regarding impact reporting, Ferrovie will report to the extent possible on relevant impact metrics, for 
each eligible project category on an annual basis. The reporting will be made available on Ferrovie’s 
website. Since the trains eligible for the use of proceeds have energy measurement systems  installed, the 
company is well positioned to provide relevant metrics.  ","Alignment with/contribution to SDGs  
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in September 2015 and form an agenda for achieving 
sustainable development by the year 2030. These goals are widely considered the next step to the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which were time -bound to 2015 . The bon d’s use of proceeds 
contributes  to the following SDGs:  ","The company’s management of the bond proceeds and reporting are aligned with market practices. To 
manage the bond ’s proceeds, Ferrovie has a dedicated green bond working committee, i ncluding

Impact of electric rail transit on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction  
In addition, advancing rail transportation is closely linked to achieving climate targets  and to the EU -wide 
reduction targets for GHG emissions from transportation outlined in the “Roadmap to a Single European 
Transport Area .”11 The Commission aspires to meet these targets by priorit ising modes of transportation 
that can easily carry large numbers of passengers, such as rail, over cars. Advancing the  rail transit is also 
likely to contribute to the Italy ’s GHG emission target of 40% reduction by 2030 compared  to 1990 levels, 
given that t he transportation sector in Italy contributed 27.95% of Italy’s  GHG emissions in 2012 .12  ","[2, 4, 10]"

Framework  
Summary  
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that Volkswagen ’s Green Finance  Framework is credible and impactful,  and 
aligns with the four core components  of the Green Bond Principles 201 8 and Green Loan Principles 2018 . 
Sustainalytics highlights the following elements of Volkswagen’s  Green Finance Framework : 
• Use of Proceeds:  
- The use of proceeds category – namely Clean Transportation  – is recognized as impactful by 
the GBP 2018  and GLP 2018 . The eligible projects in this category provide meaningful 
environmental contributions. Sustainalytic s views VW’s allocation of proceeds to be  foster ing 
innovation towards sustainable transportation and cities .  
- The eligible proceeds will be allocated to support the development of clean mobility, through the 
development and manufacture of the Modular -Electrification Toolkit (MEB) technology for 
electric vehicles  and e -charging infrastructure . MEB  is a platform that is exclusively used for 
electric vehicles. VW clarified the fo llowing details of the MEB related use of p roceeds : 
▪ Development that is linked directly to the MEB  
▪ Manufacture of the MEB and of el ectric vehicles and their key components  related to 
the MEB  
▪ Dedicated e -charging infrastructure  
- Sustainalytics positively notes that the proceeds are exclusively used for electric vehicles  or

Committee as guests. The  GFC meets at least on an annual  basis.   
- Based on a formal establishment of a dedicated committee formed by cross -department and 
management members, Sustainalytics considers the project evaluation and selection process to 
be in line with market practice .  
• Management of Proceeds:  
- VW will manage the green bond and loan proceeds in a portfolio approach. All eligible project 
proceeds will be allocated to the Eligible Green Project  Portfolio based on the evaluation and 
selection process stated above. The expen diture and development costs will all be tracked using 
VW’s internal reporting system.  Sustain alytics positively highlights that the process for tracking 
has been reviewed by an external auditor based on ISAE 3000 (limited assurance).  
- Pending full allocation , re -allocation, or unallocated proceeds will be invested in cash or other 
liquid marketable instruments.  
- Sustainalytics cons iders this to be in line with market practice . 
• Reporting:  
- VW intends to publish annually the allocation and impact reporting of the proceeds until full 
allocation. The balance of allocated and unallocated proceeds as well as the number of new and 
existing projects will be disclosed in the allocation reports. CO₂ emissions avoided in the use 
and production phases, along with the description of the green projects and results of Life Cycle

of an Electric Vehicle ( EV) during its complete lifecycle, it is crucial to know which energy source is used to 
charge the electric batteries.23 According to the EU, electric  mobility can help to cut GHG emissions if EVs 
use electricity which is at least partly generated from renewa ble sources during their entire life cycle.24 Other 
influencing factors for the potential of EVs to reducing GHG emissions include the t otal mileage d uring the life 
cycle and disposal of the components at the end of the life cycle. Thus, t he use phase is w here the largest 
reduction potential take s place  when comparing EVs to a conventional vehicle.24 If the EVs are mostly charged 
using energy from a renewable source, the higher GHG emissions produced during the manufacturing phase 
can be offset during the use phase.24 Given an expected  increase in renewable energy to meet the global 
energy demand by one -fifth in the next five years to reach 12.4% in 2023,25 Sustainalytics is of the opinion 
that electric vehicles can contribute to reduce GHG emiss ions in the transport sector.  VW itself conducted a 
life cycle assessment to compare the carbon footprint of its current Golf TDI (Diesel)  and its e -Golf, indicating 
that the e -Golf emits 15% less CO 2/km on average over its lifetime .  ","[4, 7, 9]"
