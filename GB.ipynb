              " 'American Municipal Power, Inc. (“AMP”), a non-profit wholesale power supplier and services provider, has engaged Sustainalytics to review its planned Combined Hydroelectric Projects Revenue Bonds, Series 2016A (Green Bonds) (the “Bonds”) and provide an opinion as to the environmental benefits of the projects to be financed and the adherence of the bonds to the Green Bond Principles. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics held conversations with AMP’s treasury and sustainability teams to understand the use and management of proceeds of the Bonds as well as sustainability strategy of AMP. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public and internal documents and provided its opinion on the Bonds. This document contains two sections:  Framework Overview – a summary of AMP’s Green Bond framework; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the framework.   ',\n",

The Projects consist of the Cannelton Project, an 88 MW project located on the Kentucky shore of the Cannelton Locks and Dam on the Ohio River; the Smithland Project, a 76 MW project located on the Kentucky shore of the Smithland Lock and Dam on the Ohio River; and the Willow Island Project, a 44 MW project located on the West Virginia shore of the Willow Island Locks and Dam on the Ohio River.

AMP recognizes that reductions of airborne emissions can be achieved through investing in zero-emission generation technologies, such as hydroelectric and other renewable energy sources. AMP believes that greenhouse gas emissions will be limited at some point in the future, and therefore the company aims to prudently invest in projects to offset carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions from its fossil fuel generation resources.1  ',\n",

The site includes an intake approach channel, a reinforced concrete powerhouse and a tailrace channel.

The Willow Island Project diverts water from the existing Army Corps Willow Island Locks and Dam through two 22 MW bulb turbines and will have an estimated total rated capacity of 44 MW. The site includes an intake approach channel, a reinforced concrete powerhouse and a tailrace channel.

              " 'Commitment to renewable energy development: In 2005, AMP’s Board of Trustees, (the “Board”) adopted the company’s Environmental Stewardship Principles. The principles were renamed the Sustainability Principles in 2011, and are periodically revised, with the last revision by the Board taking place in 2013. There are currently seven Sustainability Principles that AMP uses to guide its approach to sustainability. These principles include a commitment to providing a balanced and sustainable power supply portfolio and reducing the company’s overall emissions profile. To adhere to these commitments, AMP has made significant investments in renewable energy, including run-of-river hydroelectric, wind, solar, and landfill gas. In addition, the company plans to publicly report GHG emissions avoidance data on an annual basis, demonstrating a commitment to transparency.  ',\n",
              " 'Large-scale run-of-river hydro with overall positive impact: Sustainalytics recognizes that the Projects do not fall within the generally accepted limit for small-scale run-of-river hydro of 15 MW. However, because the Projects are located at existing dams on the Ohio River, they will not result in the negative environmental impacts, such as loss of wildlife habitat and aquatic biodiversity, that are often associated with large-scale hydro development, which typically involves the construction of a new dam and reservoir. Sustainalytics is therefore of the opinion that the Projects offer clear environmental benefits and net positive impact. This view is in line with generally accepted standards.2 ',\n",

',\n",
              " 'The Projects financed with the proceeds of the Bonds provide GHG-emission-free renewable energy to the municipalities that AMP serves. Although the Projects are considered large-scale hydro, the construction has occurred on existing dams on the Ohio River, and has therefore avoided any of the negative impacts that are often associated with large-scale hydroelectric development projects. Furthermore, the Projects have received the required environmental permits under the Clean Water Act and the Navigable Rivers and Harbors Act. Hence, investing in the Bonds can be seen as investing in renewable energy generation that results in a positive environmental impact. ',\n",
